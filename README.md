The best way to read this is to install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). It’s a simple notes/docs app, but will change your life in many ways. Instructions:

1. Clone this repo (or click “Download ZIP” from the green `<Code>` menu at the top right)
2. Install Obsidian
3. Open Obsidian, and click “Open folder as vault”

This is what the book looks like in Obsidian:

Alternatively there is a website for quick viewing: https://srajma.github.io/book/ but it does not display embeds (used throughout the book to display quotes from primary sources and “special sections” like speeches, letters and lectures of characters in the book.)
