this might happen when Augraseniya makes a bad decision e.g. send the entire army to the Central Country to force vassals into submission.

See why assassinations need to be controlled and targeted? Augraseniya was the perfect man for this job: inexperienced, wanting to show himself better than his brother and decisive etc., looks down on Sakadala. If we had assassinated Augraseniya, the princes would ascend the throne and Sakadala would take over as regent.

We’ll assassinate Augraseniya when we need someone smart leading Magadha? 

Why would we need that? 

A game isn’t necessarily “between” two people, Magadha might make decisions that are detrimental to both us and them, either benefiting some third party or benefiting no one. If such a situation arises, we would need to have a leader who’s smart enough to not do that. 

You know, we could hurt Magadha quite easily. Magadha is an extraordinarily unstable empire, due to all the assassinations. It’s held together by one man and one man only: Sakadala. But we need him to create that stability when you take over as emperor.
