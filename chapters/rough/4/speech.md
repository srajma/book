Magadha announces an attack on Chandragupta and local kings’s army (those who are not loyal to Magadha will be executed). Chandragupta starts talking to his army about invading Magadha – they are hesitant. Chandragupta peps them up – these people wish to execute you for protecting your empire, etc. 

You are waiting for fate to end the Nanda empire. You _are_ fate! Eventually reveals the seal of the Heir of Mathura. 

Back-and-forth between Chanakya’s previous discussion with Chandragupta and Chandragupta’s speech: we must attack and take the throne swiftly, Magadha’s eyes and ears are everywhere, but we must progress faster than their nerves. Magadha already _knows_ of our plans, of course, but they won’t bother doing anything significant until it hits them in the face, that is the nature of bureaucracy, that is the nature of people.

Tonight will be the night that you shall make history. Tonight, my men, marks the day that you will be immortalized in history as the men who realized Vasudeva’s dream, the men who defeated the worst of odds, the men who built the greatest empire ever known, the men who built India! 

And the Mauryan Emperor set eyes upon his army for the first time.
