Swill try to deter us from conquering Magadha immediately by making it expensive. No â€“ the destruction of an enemy is desirable. We cannot allow him the chance to regrow his army and maintain a perpetual powerful enemy state on our Eastern border. Magadha must be conquered. We must show him that we are able to either out-smart him, or bear the costs he imposes on us. That we truly desire Magadha, and it is futile to protect her.
