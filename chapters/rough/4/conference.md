King of Mathura calls council of kings, Chanakya an unexpected guest. Chanakya advises: Chandragupta may not have a noble lineage, but the Nandas have the opposite of one. The lack of a noble lineage means no information on his honorability, but for the Nandas, we have information against their honorability. I would say give him a chance, but that is underselling it, he is our beacon of hope. I have monitored multiple candidates, including Pabbata. But Chandragupta has a sensibility that fits him to be king – I do not wish to speak ill of the dead, but Pabbata was immature to attack Pataliputra directly. Objection: No doubt Chandragupta is a celebrated hero, but heroes are not meant to rule. Chanakya muses: An upstart hero whose feats gave him the upward mobility to rule as a king among kings. What does that remind me of? Are you comparing Chandragupta to Lord Vishnu? Do not be offended at comparisons, it is an analogy not an equation. Regardless, Chandragupta’s heroism is not that of a warrior, it is that of a leader … The kings agree to let their armies train together. While training, Chandragupta evokes passion in army against Magadha, which Chanakya does amongst the kings.
