Chanakya initially draws Sakadala into a sense of security thinking that they wonâ€™t pay too many costs to conquer Magadha. Sakadala will be expecting us to attack Vaishali first, to secure it. Instead we shall attack Pataliputra and place it under siege, _then_ send an army to fight Vaishali when they are unable to communicate with Pataliputra. This will serve two purposes: one, to demonstrate to Sakadala that we will capture Magadha, and not be satisfied with Vaishali alone. Two, to take him by surprise, before he has the time to properly fortify Pataliputra.
