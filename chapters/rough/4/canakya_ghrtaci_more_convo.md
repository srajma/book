Why didn’t you train _me_? Why did you train _him_?

Such a huge favour, like education? I only do it to someone whose trust I need to gain — and I need to gain the trust of those whose I intend to use and then discard.

So you don’t intend to do that to me?

Well if I did, I don’t think I would need to struggle so hard to gain your trust.
