Cāṇakya tells him he found a woman by the name of Añjanā (or perhaps her husband Puṣyaguptā) who swore to destroy Pabbata for killing her brother, destroying her people and city. This does not affect me, but if you are loyal to Pabbata, this might be relevant to you. Candragupta tells him that’s his sister. Maybe capture her? But do you think Pabbata will spare her once he becomes king? Do you wish for her to live in slavery all her life?

Either you lose your master, or your sister loses hers. 

Whatever solutions you come up with— the point is, a man who is loyal to a master can never protect what is dearest to him. Why do you think men seek power, Candragupta? Because that is the only way they know they can protect what they care for — be it their creations, their values or their family. 

Later he goes to Puṣyagupta and Añjanā and asks them for a loan to help Pabbata. “Whatever we earn, the king takes away. But in any case, I would hardly aid the man who killed my brother.” He tells her brother is still alive; second choice to be king if Pabbata happens to die.

the great disadvantage of being a martyr is that you have to die for it – it is far better to have someone else martyr themselves, then take the credit
