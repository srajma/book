Chanakya says, indeed those interpretations will be true, if you abdicate to Shravanabelagola. Chandragupta stays silent. Chandragupta, do you believe that I killed your wife? No, says Chandragupta. Such is the nature of the mind, says Chanakya. A rational mind has the strength to prevent a known untruth from affecting one’s beliefs, but not one’s emotions. I apologize for disappointing you, Professor. You know I don’t like apologies. But disappoint, Chandragupta? Chandragupta, my most favorite student, you have created an unprecedent golden age in the history of all India, the largest empire the world has ever seen, administered word-for-word based on my teachings, nothing short of a heaven for great minds and merchants. You think that there is any evil you could do that could negate that? I see that your mind is set, thus there is no point in convincing you to stay and do a job that you no longer enjoy. I too do not enjoy the world of administration. And as you will no longer be emperor, convincing you of the fallacies of religion is no longer worth my time.

Chanakya is worried of what will happen of the Mauryavamsha – will the man whom I set about to Sanskritize Magadha, will his own dynasty end up Magadhizing Aryavarta? Thera asks Chanakya why he isn’t stopping all this nonsense that’s happening around him – Chanakya says he doesn’t have the time. Why doesn’t Vishnu intervene on every problem? He only shows the way, etc.
