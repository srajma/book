_My prince. My Lord. Forgive me, for I have lied to you, and acted as an enemy to you – consistently, repeatedly, and in more ways than you could imagine. But not in the way that you will be told I have, by the Prime Minister and his allies._

_For months now, Prime Minister Sakadala has been hypnotizing me — to carry out all sorts of wicked plans for him. I have been aware of this hypnosis, but rendered unable to reveal it to you, that is the strength of his powers. With great willpower, I have tried, repeatedly, to give you hints, but anything explicit would refuse to escape my lips – I was bound._

_I did not kill your father – it was Sakadala. He forced me to lie to you, so as to take suspicion off the real culprits. Who this may be, I do not know – but I know that Sakadala is complicit in it. I called the Brāhmaṇa hypnotist from Ayodhya, as I had heard that a hypnotist could reverse the effects of a previous hypnosis – but as you forbade a private audience, and I was bound from telling you why that attempt failed as well. I do not hold it against you – I would never hold anything against you, my beloved – you did not know._

_This evening, Sakadala came to my bedroom – he gave me a poison pellet – and he gave me one last, horrible instruction: to kill you, my Lord._

_I would like to say that my love for you would make me resist this instruction, to overcome Sakadala’s dark powers. And I do believe it would. But I cannot take that risk. I would rather die. And so, I will._

_This is my last, and final message to you, my Lord. Your beloved Rūpakośa wishes you a long and joyful life._
