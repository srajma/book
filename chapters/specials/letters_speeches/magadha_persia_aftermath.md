The messenger rose from his prostrated state, keeping his posture formal.

“There are several pieces of grave news, O Great King of Kings,” said Haxamanish solemnly, his head bowed and his body trembling. He looked toward the courtiers helplessly, seeking their advice – the most aged of them, the Emperor’s most trusted advisor Ariyawratha, gave him a subtle encouraging nod, as if instructing him to proceed with the news without excessive formality.

“Firstly – our most prosperous province, Gandhāra, has been invaded by the Matsyaka Queen Kṛpā, who has secured the Western parts of the province. King Āmbhi remains is loyal to us, but his court is fragmented, with his own son joining the rebels, and he is forced to invest his resources against the advances of his Eastern rivals in Hind, who, as you are aware, had rebelled again from us several years prior, with the support of the Yaudheyas, depriving us of a third of our government revenues.

The court was silent – not because they were fearful, or because they had no questions to raise, but because they did not know what to feel, or what to think without explicit instruction from their God-king. But the God-king Darayavaush himself remained stoic, finding himself in a more complicated situation than he had ever known.

It was Ariyawratha who spoke.

“And how have they contracted the Yaudheyas, messenger? Surely they lack the funds to do so.”

Haxamanish was shivering.

“I believe … I believe, O Great King of Kings, and do forgive me for raising such an inauspicious possibility … I believe that security of the Imperial tax collection in Hind has been breached.”

Darayavaush slammed his fist down in rage.

“Do they believe that the Empire has no funds of its own beyond an annual collection from Hind? That we are entirely reliant on a mere two provinces for our entire administration, that we will allow such a prosperous country to secede from the empire without consequence?”

But his words were vacuous – for all in the court knew that Hind alone contributed a third of Imperial revenue, and the treasury had not saved as much from previous years as it ought to responsibly have. If Hind rebelled, and Gandhāra’s position was seen as weak by the other Indian states, it was almost certain that the remaining states of the Punjab would pledge their support to Hind – or make a show of surrender to them.

“What is the cause of these events?” asked Ariyawratha “What is that factor that has undergone such change in the East, that it appears the Empire is left with no allies in the region?”

“Ally or no ally,” the Emperor growled, “We shall crush these rebellions and punish the traitors and all those who supported them, even if it bankrupts the treasury. I shall not be known as the Emperor who lost India.”

“It appears—,” started Haxamanish, “There are rumours— there are reliable reports, that the Eastern Empire … ” he controlled his stammering, “The Eastern Empire is expanding its boundaries once again. It appears that they are preparing for a Westward expedition soon – and is likely that they are sowing dissension in our Eastern provinces either with intent to conquer them, or to secure their independence from the Empire so they can be used as buffer states against us.”

Darayavaush let out a low growl. “So these rebels believe that the Easterners will come to their assistance?”

The messenger nodded. “The Easterners have set their sights on the city of Indraprastha – a site that is sacred to all Indians. If they conquer Indraprastha, they will truly be unstoppable, or so it is believed. But that is not all.”

“What could be worse than all that we have just heard?” Ariyawratha muttered dejectedly, but no one heard him. Even as he had only seen in all his life a Persia undefeated in battle, he was still possessed of sufficient age and sense to see the signs.

“The third piece of news,” Haxamanish stammered – his voice had become barely intelligible at this point, “O Great King of Kings … The rebellion is not only in the East – if rumour is correct … the king of the Greeks, Alexander, is planning an invasion of Persia. I fear to say this, Emperor – but such are the words used by your enemies in this very court: they say that the end times are near!— that the _Frashokereti_ approaches!”

The messenger’s bloodied head rolled down the carpet.
