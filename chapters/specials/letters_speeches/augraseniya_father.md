_Father,_

_This is a message from your loyal son and true successor, Augraseniya._

_I have come to realize that at its core, Pabbata’s war is against me, not against you. And it is I who must fight it._

_In letting the offender Cāṇakya go free, you have provided Pabbata with a critical resource in his war against me: namely, the support of all our neighbouring states. Likewise, I ask that you also provide me with the resources that are rightfully mine, command over at least a portion of those resources that I am truly fighting to secure for Magadha._

_Namely, I request final say, as well as direct command in emergencies, over the positioning of imperial troops, over spies, over trade policy and foreign relations and management of the logistics of the Northern Highway. My commands on this matter will overrule Sakadala’s opinion on every count._

_In my first decision since assuming this command: I overrule Sakadala’s assignment of additional troops to the Western border, as well as his dispatch of spies to the Western kingdoms. I order, in place of these actions, a full ban on the transmit of all persons and items in or out of Magadhi territory. All messages or essential goods for trade will be exchanged at a heavily-guarded checkpoint on the Westernmost extreme of our territory on the Uttarapatha._

_Furthermore, I will hereby take command of all operations started by Sakadala to identify and capture Pabbata’s spies in our midst, whether in the dungeons, in security, in any other government employment or otherwise._

_I request your generosity in allowing me to proceed so, Father. I trust nobody but you, in this war._
