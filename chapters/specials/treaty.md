_[Copy held by Candragupta and his successors]_

SECTION ONE: CONCLUSION TO THE WAR AND MAINTENANCE OF PEACE

Candragupta takes possession, from Suluva, of the following territories through direct conquest: Gandhāra, Sindh – and, also from Suluva, of the following territories as a gift made in the interest of peace: Kamboja, Paaraavata (called Sarasvati by the locals), Makara, and Pani (called Sareyu by the locals).

Of conflicts between parties: Both parties agree to the cessation of all conflict on the border, and to the suppression (including preventative measures, and assisting the other party in such event) of any petty troublemakers who stand in the way of this goal.

Of conflicts interesting to only to one party: This alliance is one of mutual peace, not of unity against unrelated enemies, thus neither party is obliged to assist the other in a war outside its own circle of interest. However, mutually beneficial trades may be facilitated.

Of conflicts over mutually interesting territory: There is a possibility that either party may wage war in a region not controlled by either party, but is of interest to both. In such an event, the parties may fail to co-ordinate their efforts or to reach an agreement on the sharing of what is acquired. To avoid this cost, the following norms are instituted:

First: Both parties recognize each other as imperial powers with ambitions exceeding their current control. All the countries of Bhāratavarṣa, the countries to its East by sea, the countries to the East of Kaśmīra, and all islands under 40 yojanas from the coast of Bhāratavarṣa are considered the “realm” of Candragupta; all the countries currently under the rule of a tribe of Yavanas, all the countries to their West, and all islands within 40 yojanas of any of these countries, are consisidered the “realm” of Suluva. Neither party will wage war, without permission, in the realm of the other party. If they wage such a war, all that is acquired from that war shall be handed to the other party, unless explicitly sold to them by the other party.

Second: The parties may, through mutual agreement, change the constitution of these realms only if one of them finds in the other’s realm a serious threat to his own security – but not in response to finding in the other’s realm an article of great value.

Third: Neither party will be held responsible for the actions of other rulers in his realm that he has not yet conquered, and is not responsible for nuisances to the other party arising from such faults.

Fourth: The countries not listed as part of the realms of either party: the nomadic tribes of beyond the Northern Highway, the countries of the Black Greeks and many mid-laying various islands of the Sea of Gems, are considered the realm of barbarians, and efforts by either party to conquer them are considered honourable.

Fifth: If a conflict ever does arise, both parties must take care to ensure the conflict does not affect the peace in other areas, and does not nullify any part of this treaty on questions explicitly addressed by it.

Of relationships with the other party’s enemies: Neither party may sell any such good to a country that the other party is at war with, which they would themselves block to their enemy in wartime. Both parties will make reasonable efforts to prevent private merchants under their sovereignty from making such trades.

SECTION TWO: TRADE

Both parties will allow merchants from the other to trade at their ports, cities and outposts, at taxes no higher than what their own merchants are required to pay.

Travelers – merchants, scholars, men of religion – from each party’s country may be required to live in segregated areas, but will be treated with equal dignity under law unless bought as (or born to) a slave.

Scholars from either party ,ay live, speak and preach among the academies, universities and libraries of the other party’s country, and obtain knowledge from willing scholars of the other party’s country, unless declared a matter of national secrecy.

FINAL REMARKS

This treaty will be inherited by the successors of each party, without explicit renewal.

The successors should nonetheless re-affirm the treaty to avoid ambiguity on questions of whom to recognize as successor.

The two sections are held independently of each other: i.e. the voiding of one section does not void the other.

In the event that any of the terms of this treaty is violated, both parties should take care to ensure that the response is proportionate, i.e. that it not be met with an even larger violation of this treaty, leading to destructive escalation – and the goal should always be the restoration of normalcy, not retribution driven by anger.

In the event that the peace between these parties ever breaks and this treaty is no longer held valid, the successors should be reminded of the noble aspirations of their heroic forefathers who crafted this treaty, and should be mindful to treat each other as civilized men treat each other.

SUPPLEMENT: A FIRST TRADE BETWEEN THE TWO KINGS

As both parties are currently embroiled in wars for dominance over their respective realms, they agree to make the following trades to their mutual benefit.

Candragupta receives 4000 Greek mercenary troops (infantry) and 50 besieging units, inspected for quality by his agents, in addition to those already captured in war.

Suluva receives 500 armoured war elephants, with their mahouts, and 20 Dronas of explosive powders, inspected for quality by his agents.

Of relationships with the other party’s enemies: Neither party may sell any such good to a country that the other party is at war with, which they would themselves block to their enemy in wartime.
