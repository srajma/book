RĀJAMAṆḌALA [first recension].

Play with at least six players. One player is appointed Emperor (_Samrāṭa_), whose identity is known to everyone. The remaining players are vassal kings (_Raja_), two of whom are spies (_Guptacara_), known to each other but not to the Emperor or the other players, and the remaining are loyals (_Anurāga_). Each king publicly chooses a seal (_mudra_), which the Emperor keeps several copies of – each copy of a seal is labelled by numbers 1, 2, 3 …

Each round, the following events occur:

 - Sleep (_nidra_): All players including the Emperor close their eyes
 - Assignment (_niyoga_): Out of the seals, one of the spies’ seals is chosen
- Crime (_doṣa_): The chosen spy opens his eyes and chooses a loyal to kill
- Observation (_sākṣi_): Out of the remaining seals, half of them are chosen with replacement (so repetition is possible) and distributed among some random kings, functioning as alibis for that half.
 - Waking (_jāgaraṇa_): All players open their eyes, and the victim is revealed.
 - Interrogation (_sākṣipraśna_): Kings tell the Emperor whom they can vouch for – a loyal will tell the truth based on the seal, if any, that he was given that night; a spy may lie or hide information.
 - Execution (_vadha_): The Emperor may decide to execute a king, or to show mercy until receiving more information.

If all spies are killed, the game ends with victory for the emperor. If all loyals are killed, _Rajahatya_ (assassination) commences and the game ends with victory for the spies. The loyal kings win whatever they earned from the Emperor for their information, and are neutral to the outcome of the game between the Emperor and the spies.
