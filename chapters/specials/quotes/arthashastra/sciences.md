## sciences
> The Bārhaspatyas say that there are only two sciences: the science of business and the science of government, and the triple Vedas are merely an abridgment for a man experienced in wordly affairs.
> 
> But Kautilya holds that these four and only these four are the sciences (natural and logical science, the triple Vedas, the science of business, the science of government); wherefore it is from these sciences that all that concerns righteousness and wealth is learnt, therefore they are so called.
