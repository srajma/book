> Weapons and armour shall be entered into the armoury only after they are marked with the king's seal. Persons with weapons shall not be allowed to move anywhere unless they are permitted by a passport. When weapons are either lost or spoilt, the superintendent shall pay double their value; an account of the weapons that are destroyed shall be kept up. Boundary-guards shall take away the weapons and armour possessed by caravans unless the latter are provided with a passport to travel with weapons.
