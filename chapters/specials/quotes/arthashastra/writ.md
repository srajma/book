## writ
> Preceptors say that the word “command”, is applicable only to royal writs. Writs are of great importance to kings inasmuch as treaties and ultimate leading to war depend upon writs.
> 
> —Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 2.10:1
> 
> Later commentary: As oral order sent through messengers is liable to misrepresentation, owing to misunderstanding, carelessness, and want of intelligence of the messengers, it is only writing on palm leaf that deserves the name of royal order
