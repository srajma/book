## hunter
> With regard to a wise and a brave prince, a wise prince, even if timid, is characterized with capacity for intellectual works; and a brave prince even if not wise, possesses warlike spirit. So far as warlike spirit is concerned, a wise prince overreaches a brave one just as a hunter does an elephant.
