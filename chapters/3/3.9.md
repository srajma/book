## Showing empathy

“Read it,” the Emperor ordered, his eyes bloodshot.

Emperor Augraseniya was seething.

“Prime Minister … ” whispered his sister Durdhara, her eyes wet, “This betrayal … I used to think of you as equal to my father!”

Sakadala looked more insulted than anything.

“If I had truly hypnotized her to bind her from revealing the fact,” he said very slowly, “Then _how was she able to write this letter_?”

“Her love,” exclaimed Augraseniya indignantly, tears brimming in his eyes – “Her _love_ for me overcame the wicked powers you wield. You must not feel so good right now – that must have been a serious blow to your pride.”

“If her account of the events is true, I would have found her body in her room _after_ the act – whereas I saw her commit suicide _before my very eyes_, which explains why I had my family sent away to safety before reporting her death, because I _predicted_ you would react badly—”

“You truly have no understanding of human emotion, do you?” Durdhara whispered in a hushed whisper, as if he were making a profound discovery about human nature, “You calculating, stone-faced, heartless Brāhmaṇa, never dispensing with the logic—”

“Princess, my account is _confirmed by_ _witnesses_—”

Augraseniya bellowed. “_WITNESSES_? Why, because my beloved’s word counts for nothing? And only half of your supposed witnesses even confirmed your account – the other half denied even being there!”

“Because they are afraid of you—”

His brother Kaivarta interrupted, his face lighting up in newfound realization. “He killed our grandfather,” he announced, “I’m sure he did. Then he killed our father. And then he came for you. He is … I swear, brother – as long as I am alive, I will be by your side, and so will our sister – he will have nobody to replace you with. Nobody.”

The young emperor’s face, however, showed no signs of acknowledgement – instead, it only bore a look of heavy thoughtfulness, and everyone in the courtroom knew better than to speak before him and get beheaded.

When he spoke, it was almost a hushed whisper.

“He came for me,” he repeated the words of his brother, his pace slow and filled with such bittersweet, genuine emotion, “He came for me. But my beloved Karenumati took the poison for me.”

Sakadala exclaimed in frustration. “_Karenumati was a spy!_”

“_Karenumati was my friend!_” Durdhara retorted – she was shaking. “She was not a spy – I _know_ it. I _feel_ it. Do you know what it means, to truly know a person, a friend, a family member, a lover? I _knew_ Karenumati, and so did my brother. And … and if what you are saying were even – and I cannot even force myself to consider this possibility – if any of it were true, if she committed suicide before you – then when would she have written the letter?”

“_She DIDN’T._ It was not found on her person. It was later fabricated, by another spy. There is a conspiracy—”

“_Another_ spy?” cried a courtier, “So I suppose we are _all_ spies now, are we not?”

“No,” said Sakadala, his eyes narrowing, “But by that reaction, I find it likely that you are one.”

“So yes,” cried another “We are all spies, everybody, we are all spies! And fools – if we were to believe this drivel!”

The Emperor raised one hand.

The court went silent.

His eyes were closed.

They waited.

“For the assassinations of two successive reigning kings … ” (his voice was heavy, and unstable) “for the assassination attempt on a third, for conspiracy against the royal family and the state, and for the … and for the MURDER of my dear, innocent, Karenumati … _BEHEAD HIM! BEHEAD HIM, AND THEN ALL HIS SUPPOSED WITNESSES!_”

But the official executioner had taken Sakadala’s side.

So soldiers marched forward, swords drawn, but gait uncertain.

A defensive phalanx formed around the Prime Minister, and some archers began pre-emptively shooting at the others, sowing confusion.

Another defensive phalanx quickly formed around Augraseniya – and around Kaivarta, and Durdhara, as it became clear what was happening.

The Prime Minister took to his steed – as his loyal soldiers slaughtered the guards, taking them by surprise.

As the faction of the army loyal to him followed to surround him, he stopped and called out:

“And to respond to your accusations, Kaivarta,” he pronounced slowly, “The instability of the throne of Pāṭaliputra well predates my presence here, but your own dynasty does _not_, having been installed by me. Nonetheless, there are several different competent men I could place on the throne in place of your brother.”

It was a fallacy, Cāṇakya would say – even though the literature was often written in such terms as to say “one who does such activity will surely achieve such result” – to view any man, even himself, as an infallible genius – one who could foresee all the exact consequences of his potential decisions, and act accordingly. Even predicting the outcome of a single social interaction was infeasible – much less that of a whole chain, or several interlocking chains of such events. Thus, it was always necessary to have a large number of well-thought-out plans with a substantial chance of success, so that at least one comes to fruition – it was necessary to ensure your future plans did not _depend_ on any particular thread – and it was important to so fully understand the social and political institutions that existed that any plot you carried out felt as natural as a motion of your body, the same advice as was taught to those learning to ride a horse for the first time.

The assassination of Dhanānanda had only two goals, intended by Cāṇakya: one, to silence him before it became known that the emergency edict demanding the states of the Central Country to send their armies Westward to fight the Greeks was forged – and he had increased the success of this plan by exerting an influence on the crown prince via Karenumati and by framing the Greeks for the assassination so as to portray anyone (especially Sakadala, the one sane man holding the Magadhi state together) who doubted the edict as treasonous – and two, to create an atmosphere of instability within Magadha, so as to make a future transition of power seem more acceptable.

But the plan accomplished much more than even the young professor had anticipated.

Karenumati’s death had provoked a tripartite civil war in Magadha – the parties to which were:

One, an emperor who had consulted with a Brāhmaṇa seer, and for whatever reason – some believed that the hypnotist had subtly implanted a thought, some believed that the influence of Karenumati had altered his character – _did not despise Brāhmaṇas_ – did not even insult the caste of the man who was believed to have murdered his father!

Two, a rebel prince who had studied in Takṣaśilā and explicitly proclaimed his acceptance of a Brāhmaṇa professor and of the Vedic ways.

Three, a literal Brāhmaṇa. Who, despite having murdered the reigning Magadhi emperor, was somehow not only considered an actual contender for the throne, but even enjoyed the open support of a large number of important members of the Magadhi government – perhaps even more closeted supporters – and nobody even seemed to be bothered by this!

One thing had become very clear to the people of Magadha:

Their way of life was dying.

The Brāhmaṇas were winning.

The light of the Vedas was burning through the country—

—for the Sun had risen in the West.
