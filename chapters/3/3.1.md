_All human actions are transactions, including the pleasurable interactions between a man and a woman._

_When, due to the difficulty of the task or the beholder’s lack of intellectual capacities, the value of a transaction becomes difficult to judge, the beholder resorts to relying on the judgement of others. This is how even the uneducated know to pay respects to scholars of intellectual and masculine gait and clothing, and this is why a woman’s admiration of a man is based on his appraisal by others; while among civilized women these others are her parents, among barbarians, these are her companions of similar age._

_Such people may be deceived easily by adopting false appearances. Thus the argument for why a government must be wary of heretical ascetics – for it is the one fatal folly of the Āryas, that we are inclined to trust the words of anyone who lives in self-imposed poverty, dons a simple garb and speaks platitudes of peace and mysticism._

Why, one might ask, had Professor Cāṇakya tasked his dearest student with the assignment of seducing Scythian women at a feast in Puṣkalāvatī?

Typically, the method of seduction was employed by female spies to extract information from important men – but the Scythians had the fatal habit of disclosing secrets to women to impress them – apart from women who themselves held political power. Minor leaks and rumours were thus widely circulated in gossip, but the wives and mistresses of men of true importance were somewhat more cautious about whom they chose to share their husbands’ secrets with, and thus extracting these secrets required more effort.

While men tended to reveal secrets in order to lay with a woman, the Professor had explained, women tended to reveal secrets after laying with a man – for they regarded their own affections as trust, and to reveal secrets then felt no different to them from revealing secrets to their husbands.

Of all the tasks that Cāṇakya had ever assigned him, none had made Candragupta – no, Śaśigupta – quite as nervous as this one. He had faltered in the past – not realizing that unlike civilized women, Bāhlīka women were not charmed by teaching them facts of geometry and grammar.

_You are the protégé of the greatest living mind in the world,_ he reminded himself.

_You are a man of civilization, amongst lowly barbarians._

_If all these ordinary men could achieve this task – then what challenge could it be to Śaśigupta, with his status, stature, intellect, wit and large frontal sinus? How foolish was it then for him to lack confidence?_

_You are the future emperor of the world_ (a tinge of guilt hit him then, for he wasn’t sure what Cāṇakya’s plans were with Pabbata) _– these women would regard it an honour to have ever received your attention; such will fill your harem; how silly would your current nervousness appear then?_

Steeling himself, Śaśigupta strode his way into the midst of a group of drunken women, outstretched his right arm to hold out one of the red fruits of the Bāhlīka country, and announced:

_“TO THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ONE!”_
