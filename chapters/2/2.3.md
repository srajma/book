“One final thing, prince,” said Devajit, still bowed before Pabbata in salute, “Our spies have been on the lookout for Cāṇakya as you directed, and I believe there is cause for you to worry about his loyalty to you.”

“Do tell,” Pabbata replied neutrally.

“Cāṇakya seems to have disappeared – he is neither in Takṣaśilā, nor among the Ārjunāyanas. I thus surveyed all reports of unusual people and activities from our territorial border and asked around using his physical description, and learned of a young boy with a black horse and a concealed face who is scouring around the Śūrasena country postulating odd questions about the _Order of Saṃkarṣaṇa_ and the _Seal of the Peacock.”

Pabbata inhaled sharply.

The Order of Saṃkarṣaṇa had been vanquished by Emperor Mahāpadma, its members executed and its forts reduced to flour – ending one hundred and fifty years of expensive war. The Seal of the Peacock had been their emblem, the banner of resistance against Magadhi imperialism. And despite the brutal manner in which Magadha had suppressed any potential future rebellions in Mathura, widespread rumour remained of an underground continued operation of the Order.

“This is his own emblem that he has shown to our disguised spies:—”

Devajit produced a clay tablet with an engraved sign on it – a +, with two arms on its top-left and one on its top-right.

“—do you recognize what this is, prince?”

Pabbata shook his head, although he recognized the Brahmi character.

The incredible thing, Pabbata realized, was that Cāṇakya would have a perfectly innocuous explanation for his antics – just as he had contacted the Ārjunāyanas to produce a conflict in Magadha, a wave that Pabbata could ride to power, this could also be his intention with courting the Order of Saṃkarṣaṇa. Of course, there were other factions within the Magadhi mainstream that he could take the support of instead, but Cāṇakya would probably argue that a larger number of players made it easier for an intelligent strategist to sow chaos, or that he had even greater goals for Pabbata than what could be achieved from within Magadha.

The problem was that depending on Cāṇakya in this way required a great deal of trust from Pabbata – as Cāṇakya had already confessed. Much easier to just impress his father by betraying Cāṇakya.

“Speak!” ordered the turban-clad man, his eyes bloodshot and filled with suspicion.

The boy had surrendered himself before him, but he still suspected a plot and had sent men to scout the camp’s surroundings to look for an ambush. The camp, located several journeys away from the capital city of Mathura in a well-disguised forested spot at the intersection of two streams, was by no means easy to find, nor was it a location that one might too often reach by chance.

Shockingly, the captive’s voice was steady, unaffected apparently by the sword that had been placed at his throat and the archers that had been readied on him.

“What do you wish to know first? And keep in mind that as I came to you voluntarily, anything you wish to know is also something I wish to be known by you.”

Achyuta took a moment to consider this.

“How did you learn of our location?” he asked finally.

The boy did not make any attempt to loosen the scarf that he had wrapped around his face. His eyes were all that were visible, and they darted upwards to meet Achyuta’s gaze.

“That’s a good start,” he said. “I thought quite hard about how I could find, in reasonable time, a people who did not wish to be found – at first, I thought of monitoring food shipments and such—”

Achyuta snorted.

“—but obviously, if you were smart, you would simply grow your own food, irrigating your fields through groundwater, or hunt for it. So I thought next: what would you most certainly have the necessity to import, that you cannot produce yourself? I realized that a camp like yours would likely be planted with traps and such devices, and I started asking around for families where an engineer had gone missing recently.”

“And what did you find?”

“I found many such families, but of course none of them knew where they had gone. Your people are very confidential in your affairs, clearly.”

“Indeed.”

“So instead I looked at matters from the following perspective: if Magadha hasn’t found your hideout yet, that must mean a limitation in their maps. So I scoured over government maps of the Śūrasena country, and identified regions where the tracts labelled appeared to be incomplete, or where there seemed to be rough transitions in the landscape that indicated a region missing from the maps.”

“There must have been many such omittances. Did you check them all?”

“_Then_ I compared these places to the sites of disappearances of Magadhi soldiers, tax collectors and other agents. Thus, I identified five possible locations for the site of your camp – this is the fourth of the sites that I checked.”

“Very clever,” Achyuta admitted grumpily. “I do not know to whom this is a greater embarrassment: to us, whose hideout was so easily exposed by a mere child, or to Magadha, who could not accomplish in so many years with their enormous number of military experts what a child did in a matter of fortnights. Who are you, boy?”

The boy slowly unwrapped his scarf to reveal his smiling lips: “You may call me _Kautilya_. And what I want from you is to coronate me as the Heir of Saṃkarṣaṇa – I desire, from you, the Seal of the Peacock.”
