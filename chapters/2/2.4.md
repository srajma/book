[date:-330|magadha,x]

Faced with war on two fronts, the mighty Persians retreated from the East, swearing to return once they had secured the Western frontier.

Concurrently to the news of Persian retreat, Śaśigupta advised the Ārjunāyanas to adopt a defensive posture against Magadha rather than to continue the pre-emptive strikes that had earlier been in motion.

Also concurrent to these events, Magadha received news of a rebellion in the Southern extremity of its empire, and diverted its forces to the city of Pratiṣṭhāna. Investigation revealed that the rebellion had been instigated by a certain Sage Paramācintya, speculation on whose motives ranged from senility to rumours of a mysterious meeting with an anonymous visitor weeks prior.

Unbeknownst to its government, an organized network of spies was growing its roots in Magadha, identifying each other with the symbol of a peacock. Merchants were privately swearing their allegiance to them, covertly funding their operations in return for great rewards promised in the future.

Far in the West, the city of Parsa burned. The regret-filled eyes of a young blond man stared at a fallen statue of Kshayaarshaa, the former Persian Emperor who had for his acts forever become an enemy to the West, and asked:

“_Shall I pass by and leave you lying here because of your invasion of Hellas? Or shall I set you up again because of your magnanimity and your virtues in other respects?_”
