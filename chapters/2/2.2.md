It was in the evening that Cāṇakya released the pigeon that they had been carrying for so long.

“What is that, Professor?” asked Candragupta – no, _Śaśigupta_, as Cāṇakya had instructed him to completely play the part of his new identity.

Cāṇakya took a long time to answer, and when he did, he simply said: “A letter.”

Śaśigupta knew better than to press further.

They stared into the fire.

Deprived of Pabbata’s company, the thirteen-year-old boys had now become fully exposed to the harshness of the journey that so many merchants had built their entire lives around – they passed through the kingdom of Puruṣottama without stopping at any town, for he was the only king to claim enmity with Gandhāra – they rested instead at the city of Śākala in the Madra country, with all its infamous over-sexualized depravities – then rode through the tracts ruled by the mercenary corporations, the Trigartas and Yaudheyas, where the roads were damaged due to the constant warring – and yet once they had passed the Yaudheya city of Śrughna and the sacred Ārjunāyana city of Indraprastha and passed into Magadhi imperial territory, the condition of the Northern Highway worsened significantly, crumbling and muddy, without a single resting place (for such resting places would be defenseless against the robbers and wild tribes who had grown powerful due to Magadhi neglect – and often even imperial patronization to instill terror in its people) … and this was just on the segment of the highway before Mathura.

(Cāṇakya remarked, at one point, that the road was worse than the road he had taken to first arrive at Takṣaśilā in his childhood – but did not elaborate further, when asked, on where that road connected to.)

“When Pabbata was with us,” Śaśigupta remarked, “We never saw this all so darkly. We can no longer simply rely on the threat of Magadhi might for our protection.”

Cāṇakya smiled wryly. “Is that how you see your master, Śaśigupta? That his function is that of a mere bodyguard to you?”

Even as Śaśigupta was quite certain of what Cāṇakya’s intentions were, and he trusted his Professor quite entirely, to hear such an accusation, made even in jest, sent a jolt of terror through his body. He laughed weakly.

Silence ensued for some time longer.

“There is a question I must ask you,” said Cāṇakya. “What is the nature of your loyalty to Pabbata?”

Śaśigupta inhaled deeply with dread, having known for far too long that this question would eventually be asked of him – if not by his Professor, then by himself. And in truth, he did not even know if it was that he did not know the answer, or that his mind simply refused to entertain that mode of thinking.

“What is of primary concern to you?” Cāṇakya continued, “His interests, or his agency? That is to say, would you be willing to keep secrets from him, or to disobey his orders, should I judge that this were in the prince’s own interests?”

“I must ask what such situation you believe my arise,” Śaśigupta questioned. “That you believe Pabbata would act in a way that is contrary to his own interests, and that this will require an intervention on my part?”

Cāṇakya’s face was grim.

“There are many excellent qualities in Pabbata,” the boy admitted. “Qualities that make him fit to be king. And yet, I worry about his suspicious mind – that his suspicions of me may cause him to act rashly, or to forgo crucial opportunities because of the risk of betrayal. I can only hope that he will trust me at least when I make him king – for what more could I give him to win his trust?”

Cāṇakya’s words were manipulative – Śaśigupta recognized that much, for his Professor was not one to _only hope_ for anything; he was the sort to make plans, or to alter made plans, to ensure that a desirable outcome occurred. He did not comment on that, however.

“I will say this much, Professor,” said Śaśigupta, “For whatever you demand of me, I shall assess the prospects, and my trust in you, independently of what Pabbata thinks. For if you believe that his mind is biased against you, then it falls upon me as his loyal companion to be the voice of reason to counter that bias.”

(But oh, did he sometimes wish things could simply be simple with Cāṇakya, for them to just act as friends of their age did.)
