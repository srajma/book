He was a true polymath – describing in his writings the first-known cryptographic ciphers, several “static and dynamic devices” and chemical concoctions including the earliest description of gunpowder, and being a sufficiently proficient medical practitioner to employ mithridatism and perform caesarean surgeries on the fly.<br>(The land that had forgotten Alexander in half a breath, had elevated Cāṇakya to a god – and perhaps even among the gods, he would excel and emerge the best of them.)<br>His philosophy of social science and political ethics remained the most prominent and politically influential for nearly a millennium after his death – with texts as distant in location as from Takṣaśilā to Pāṭaliputra to Madurai, and in subject matter as from the Panchatantra to the Kāma Sutra declaring “Wealth and wealth alone is important!”, and with his Rājamaṇḍala theory the dominant model of statecraft both in India proper and its subsidiary civilizations along the mainland and maritime routes to the East.<br>Many of his particularly idiosyncratic innovations are forever immortalized by poetic curiosity, such as: viṣakanyās (women with whom sexual contact was lethal as per legend, realistically this was a compound myth made of the factual weaponization of mithridatism and use of femme fatale assassinations); the all-female imperial guard comprised entirely; the nightly changing royal sleeping chamber.<br>His reign as Prime Minister of the empire of his creation saw a flurry of innovations, particularly in finance – cheques, private corporations and the double-accounting bookkeeping system (which would eventually lead to the celebrated development of the number zero) – in the sciences – with influential mathematician Piṅgalā and father of linguistics Pāṇini both flourishing during this period – and in religion – with the Bhagavad Gītā, the Hindu synthesis and the canonization of the Ramayana and Mahābhārata – dating to this period.<br>(From the cities that were rebuilding, after suffering centuries of destruction, with a certain confident optimism that was uniquely Indian – to far-removed villages and all the way to the mountainous peaks – all that could be heard were tales of the fantastical exploits of “Cāṇakya-Candragupta”, who had been placed in history as the intellectual descendants of famed duos from the Vedas like Mitra-Varuṇa, Indra-Agni and Vasiṣṭha-Sudās, or from the tales of bards like Saṃkarṣaṇa-Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa-Arjuna and Nara-Nārāyaṇa. Perhaps, then, it was not that Indian civilization was amnesiac – but rather it had a different order of priorities for setting things to memory – in which politics was of far less importance than science, and within politics, foreign figures had the least importance. It was such a unique form of patriotism, one wherein they did not even need to explicitly pronounce or be aware of a national identity – instead, it was simply assumed, as if it were ether, as if it were politeness or the many other oddities she had become aware of among her own people.)<br>This book tells the tale of Cāṇakya Viṣṇugupta – or as he is popularly known for his cunning, Kautilya.]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/0/0.1.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/0/0.1.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2024 08:34:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[PROLOGUE: Pratiṣṭhāna Kāṇḍa]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>[date:-340|magadha,x]<br>And thus a hundred and fifty year long war came to an end.<br>In those hundred and fifty years, the metropolis of Mathura had been surrounded several times, but each of the successive Vṛṣṇi heroes – Saṃkarṣaṇa, Vāsudeva, Pradyumna and Aniruddha – had through their wit and cunning extracted the republic out of the most untenable situations, through deceit, bribery, strategic military maneuvers and by simply being annoyingly difficult.<br>Seven times total, since Saṃkarṣaṇa and Vāsudeva’s historic victory over Ajātaśatru, had Mathura nearly fallen. Each one of those times, Mathura had been saved by a miraculous twist of events, forcing the Magadhi Army to retreat from the cities of the Śūrasenas. So much so that a religion had formed in worship of the Vṛṣṇi heroes – not only among the people of Mathura, but all across Āryāvarta, a symbol of resistance to Magadhi imperialism.<br>The true Lords of the Vṛṣṇis.<br>To men, what Viṣṇu was to the gods.<br>The Heirs of Saṃkarṣaṇa.<br>So when Samba, the current Heir of Saṃkarṣaṇa, had instructed the Śūrasena Senate to raise the flag of peace and surrender himself to the Magadhi army, few had raised questions. The Order of Saṃkarṣaṇa, Samba’s close circle of friends and advisors, was itself critical, but the Śūrasena Consul and the Senate obliged to his words.<br>“The word of the Heir is the word of the Veda,” they said.<br>When the Magadhi Imperial army had poured into the city streets, plundering and burning, raping and murdering in celebratory elation, the residents of Mathura cowered in their homes, in wait of a miracle.<br>“Do not, for a second, think I do not understand the game that you are playing. But I grow impatient, now, boy. And I have a saying, a little homage of sorts to my own background,” he gestured at the said boy’s shaved scalp, “A bald head is no use to a barber.”<br>When the Śūrasena Consul was marched back into the citadel and publicly beheaded amidst cheering from the invading savages, the people of Mathura simply watched in mute horror, awaiting the miracle.<br>The boy cringed inwardly at the silliness of his companion’s dramatically-phrased idioms.<br>“It is my pleasure that you understand the game I am playing, indeed, it is to our mutual benefit that we have no unnecessary pretenses between us, as much as we may both wish that benefit were not mutual.”<br>When the idols of Saṃkarṣaṇa and Vāsudeva were ripped from their sanctum in the city temple, the people of Mathura told each other it would be temporary, rather than an omen of their impending doom, that the Heir of Saṃkarṣaṇa would return to save them.<br>“In full honesty, boy, I am growing quite tired of your game. I might just kill you.”<br>“The name of this game is called friendship, General. This game is played through the exchange of benefits, divided into many small gifts of token size spread across a long span of time – for paying the entire gift at once makes one’s own existence useless to his friend thereafter.”<br>Samba would save them.<br>Some miracle.<br>Some unprecedented display of Śūrasena cunning.<br>The corpses of the royal family of Mathura were paraded through the streets for people to spit on. Those who refused joined the corpses themselves.<br>"Hear my words, child, and hear them carefully. Your very right to breathe is a gift from me to you. None of your small, token gifts, are worth this liberty that I have offered you."<br>Any moment now.<br>“Not even the capture of Mathura, General?”<br>"..."<br>"..."<br>"..."<br>“All I ask, General, is that you ask your army to treat the people of Mathura with dignity—don’t give me that look, I’m not asking that you actually make an effort to control your army, I just want you to say these words. This will damage your credibility amongst your army thus perpetuate your dependence on me for your future power – you see, I just don’t want our friendship to end with my gruesome murder by your hands.<br>“As soon as I hear these words from you, I will instruct the people of Mathura to surrender. And then, General, you and I will march back to Magadha with their heads. As the men who realized the dream of Ajātaśatru. The men who defeated Vāsudeva. The men who defeated the Brāhmaṇas.”<br>A flag was raised in the citadel of a burning city.<br>A stencil cut, of an elephant crushing a peacock under its feet.<br><br>[date:-340|magadha,”but in the sleepy Southern city of Pratiṣṭhāna”,x]<br>Pulled by two galloping Kamboja mares, and bearing on its banner perhaps the most recognizable symbol in all the lands inhabited by Āryas, the solar insignia of a lost ancient empire – the golden-hued chariot rode into the city.<br>(“VIṢṆUGUPTA!” a child’s voice cried out— “SOMEONE TELL VIṢṆUGUPTA! SOMEONE HAS ARRIVED – FROM TAKṢAŚILĀ!”)<br>There was only one explanation—]<br>The king of Pratiṣṭhāna bowed to the visitors with folded hands, welcoming them with genuine warmth and respect – for the Kingdom of Gandhāra, small and remote, had no enemies, it had maintained peace through strength and neutrality, by forging diplomatic ties whenever an enemy could not be crushed. No ruler would attack the kingdom, for his sons probably studied there, and its honour was without blemish.<br>(Seven-year-old Viṣṇugupta turned his head towards the band of his playmates running towards him – even comprehending the implication, his expression remained blank.)<br>“… there is a parallel,” the king was saying with reverence, “Between the history of your country and mine – just as the sage Agastya travelled Southward to establish great cities such as this one, the sage Uddālaka travelled Westward to tame the wild realm that was once your country, setting the foundation for the University of Takṣaśilā, and the city that grew around it, transforming it from a nomadic land of uncultivated pastures into one of the brightest-shining stars of civilization—”<br>The bards sang the tale of Gandhāra’s history. A tale of social transformation through peaceful means – by hosting Brāhmaṇa and Ājīvaka scholars from across the world, and students not only Ārya but also of many Iranic tribes, who in turn shaped the politics of Gandhāra. Today, the soft empire of Ayodhya was no more, except in the ethos of the people of Gandhāra, who continued to hold their country to be an extension of it.<br>(Viṣṇugupta approached the shrine just as the formalities were ending—<br>—all these formalities were pointless—there had been only one applicant to the University of Takṣaśilā that year from Pratiṣṭhāna—)<br>“ … ”<br>“—Viṣṇugupta—acceptance to the university—<br>“—Professor Caṇin was greatly impressed—the clarity of thought—<br>“—your upanayanam will be overseen—the scholarship—”<br>A far younger, and more familiar voice: “—when you become a big shot, come back to make me the king of Aśmaka—”<br>“—or more realistically an ox-cart driver—” More young voices.<br>“—or a servant at a whorehouse—”<br>Viṣṇugupta delivered the news to his mother.<br>She smiled, more widely than she had in months now.<br>It was said that mere months after Viṣṇugupta’s birth, a Nāga ascetic had visited his family’s home in search of alms. With one look at the child’s face, the ascetic proclaimed to his father:<br>“Rejoice, young man! Your son has canine teeth, the mark of royalty! He will surely be king! And a very noble one at that, who will devote all his attention to his work as a statesman, sparing none for even those closest to him!”<br>Drunk, irrationally infuriated and brought to tears, the man broke his infant son’s teeth, permanently scarring the boy’s jaw.<br>Elakṣi, horrified at what she saw on her doorstep, rushed her husband and fled with the baby Viṣṇugupta Sage Paramācintya’s ashrama in a small village on the outskirts.<br>“Foolish man! Just as burning a flag does not uproot a kingdom, just as killing the witness does not undo a murder already committed, just as stealing the literal throne does not remove a king’s power, similarly, destroying the basis for my prophecy will not destroy the ambitions already present in your son! You do not wish for your son to be king? – very well! He will be the power behind the throne – behind EVERY throne!”<br>And today, in her time of sickness, Viṣṇugupta was abandoning that very mother.<br>“This relieves me so much, my son … that I can die knowing you have gotten what you want, that you are on your path to accomplish whatever it may be your heart will desire … ”<br>He did not lie to himself about the reality of the choice he was making. He did not avoid the harsh truth: by abandoning his mother, he was likely hastening her impending death. Clichés like “that’s what she would want” were excuses people told themselves to make themselves do things that were right but did not feel right – but Viṣṇugupta did not need such excuses.<br>The choice he was making was his, and it was his responsibility alone.<br>“Do not feel guilty at my plight, Viṣṇu. I am paying the price for my own deeds. You bore the price for my foolish decision to marry your father, and I shall bear the price that you must pay for your education and your future wealth.”<br>“If there were such a thing as divine retribution for one’s deeds, mother, then it is that very deed that I owe my entire existence to, as well.” As Viṣṇugupta was only seven years old, he did not quite fully understand the concept of counterfactual utility; consequently he also did not yet know that the entire notion of divine retribution was a falsehood.<br>“Perhaps I will be rewarded for it, then,” said his mother, smiling. “In my next life.”<br>Viṣṇugupta fought back tears.<br>“Boys do not waste their rage on tears,” his mother whispered gently, “Hold them in, and channel it to accomplish great things … ”<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>The boy walked towards his mother’s feet, and grabbed them tightly, touching them to his forehead.<br>Then, folding his hands before her one last time, he turned—<br>He didn’t know what the future held for him.<br>But he knew that his acceptance had opened to him a world of opportunities that had up to this point seemed a story from fantasy.<br>—and walked way.<br>Choosing his education over years of his mother’s life.<br>The choice, put in those terms—<br>—a constant reminder of just how much he had to accomplish – whatever that may be – to justify the cost he was paying now.<br>It was a fortnight and a half to Takṣaśilā.<br>History awaited Viṣṇugupta.]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/0/0.2.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/0/0.2.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2024 18:55:19 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[1 Takṣaśilā Kāṇḍa]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br><br>sciences<br><br><br>
The Bārhaspatyas say that there are only two sciences: the science of business and the science of government, and the triple Vedas are merely an abridgment for a man experienced in wordly affairs.
But Kautilya holds that these four and only these four are the sciences (natural and logical science, the triple Vedas, the science of business, the science of government); wherefore it is from these sciences that all that concerns righteousness and wealth is learnt, therefore they are so called.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 1.2:4-9
<br>While the precise procedure was waived in cases of large monetary donations or for applicants from families with significant political sway, the traditional method of admitting students to the university was through an interview. As Brāhmaṇa initiates were most typically around the age of eight years, a formal assessment of a child’s knowledge of the Vedas, of the sciences and of the positions held on the same by various scholars and schools was impractical. While your average gurukula might merely require precise pronunciation and a conversational knowledge of the Civilized Tongue, a prestigious and selective university like Takṣaśilā looked for some kind of spark, a demonstration of insight and the capacity to think about the sciences in the correct way.<br>In Cāṇakya, however, they had found something far greater than a spark: they’d found a fire that could engulf a forest.<br>At any problem posed, Cāṇakya would, rather than immediately stating a solution, ask further questions to understand and dissect the problem, then dissect the proposed solutions to determine the precise unstated costs of these solutions, and question whether the stated dichotomy between the two solutions was even real or not. He hadn’t, at that point, been aware of the existence of the various schools or their implications for the posed problems; however, he had demonstrated a much more generalizable ability to think.<br>To the seven-year-old boy himself, who had studied the Vedas but had never seen libraries of such size, merely hearing the names of these great men and their scholarly lineages opened a whole new world to him, an experience that could only be akin to that of a conqueror crossing a mighty river that he thought marked the end of the world, doubling overnight the size of the realm of his knowledge.<br>Upon arriving at Takṣaśilā, Cāṇakya visited the lectures of every school of philosophy that he found the time for, and scoured over their cotton-paper manuscripts in the enormous library of Takṣaśilā.<br>Cāṇakya developed no affinity for the philosophy of the Ājīvakas. While he could appreciate their deterministic principles, he did not quite see how it implied that one ought to roam naked in forests. Indeed, if the Ājīvakas believed that the non-existence of free will implied the non-existence of morality, they ought to all be behaving in diverse and eccentric ways, for no one of those behaviours would be superior to another. Instead, they seemed to all conform to the very identical principle of having no ambition and of making no realistic contribution to their own lives or to the lives of others. From this Cāṇakya inferred that the philosophy was primarily a tool of the lazy and incompetent to excuse their own failings, and to flee the game of life.<br>The philosophies of Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika seemed evidently true to Cāṇakya; yet they addressed the physical sciences, a subject that wasn’t directly of interest to him.<br>The further he studied, Cāṇakya found himself inclined towards the aspects of philosophy concerned with human goals, and the behavior undertaken to achieve these goals. Philosophies that rejected the appropriateness of human ambitions and desires, whether in the name of eliminating suffering or for any other motive, thus seemed to him as fundamentally amoral and apathetic towards the condition of life.<br>The school that Cāṇakya was most impressed by in matters of philosophical importance was the school of Brihaspati. These Bārhaspatyas rejected all metaphysics, stating that all knowledge was based in the senses; furthermore, they held that it was the non-rejection of metaphysics that lead to all irrationality and to standards of dharma (righteousness, morality) that had nothing to do with human desires but instead the desires of metaphysical abstractions that lacked a basis in the senses.<br>This too, however, was unsatisfactory for Cāṇakya’s purposes, as he could not accept the complete dismissal of dharma as a valid human goal; nor the logical implication thereof that it was righteous for a king to act solely in the interest of his imperial expansion without regard for the well-being of the people.<br>Cāṇakya sought, therefore, to reconcile the Bārhaspatya rejection of the metaphysical with his own intuitive conception of dharma. To do so, he spoke to many philosophers at the university, playing the advocate of amorality to the dharmics and the advocate of dharma to the Bārhaspatyas. The only effect those conversations had, however, was to further cement his confidence, both in the Bārhaspatya philosophy and in the Vedic dharma; they did not help him make any progress towards reconciliation.<br>sceptre<br><br><br>
… my teacher says, “Whoever desires the progress of the world shall ever hold the sceptre raised. Never can there be a better instrument than the sceptre to bring people under control.”
“No,” says Kautilya, “for whoever imposes severe punishment becomes repulsive to the people; while he who awards mild punishment becomes contemptible. But whoever imposes punishment as deserved becomes respectable.”
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 1.4:6-10
<br>“Viṣṇugupta,” said the political science professor Caṇin, choosing to address his most favoured student by the name given to him by his family rather than by the epithet that his peers now addressed him with, “How might a ruler enforce some desired behaviour among the people of his kingdom?”<br>“People will always act in accordance with their own goals, not the king’s,” said Cāṇakya, “Thus in order to make someone do what you wish them to, you must make them believe that it is in their interests to do what you wish them to.”<br>The first spark.<br>“Eloquently put,” said Professor Caṇin, “Indeed, this is the basis for punishment and for the science of law itself. For whatever a king might believe will bring progress to the people of the world, punishment is the sole tool on which his power rests, the sole tool by which he may achieve his goals.”<br>“Not so,” said Cāṇakya, “The fundamental principle is that you must make them believe that the desired behaviour is in their interests. There are four ways to achieve this. First, they may have an incorrect belief that leads them to reject the action you desire them to make, or their own goals may be unknown to them, or be malleable to eloquent speech. In this case, you may dispel them of these incorrect beliefs and persuade them to act as you desire. Or there may truly be a cost that they incur by acting in the manner that you desire of them – in that case, you may either compensate them for this cost, i.e. purchase their consent, or you may impose an equal cost for non-compliance, i.e. punish their non-consent, which is the approach that you exalt. The fourth and final approach is to falsely convince them that acting in the manner you desire will be of personal benefit to them; while this appears similar to the first approach, the two methods are as far as can be, as convincing someone of the truth is a completely different art from convincing someone of a falsehood. All four of these – sāma, dāma, daṇḍa, bheda (respectively: persuasion, purchase, punishment, deceit) – as well as any combination of them, are methods that will grant you control over another person.”<br>“Perhaps these methods exist in theory,” admitted Professor Caṇin, “But they can hardly be implemented effectively. A king cannot convince a murderer to not murder, pay him to not murder, or deceive him into believing that murdering will cause him to receive divine retribution.”<br>The second spark.<br>“Certainly not all these methods are effective for every situation,” Cāṇakya conceded, “But you have chosen only one example, that of criminal deterrence, and indeed for this purpose daṇḍa is the most effective method. But dāma is used widely outside of government, in trade, agriculture and production. We are employing sāma right now, in attempting to convincing each other of what we each believe to be the truth.”<br>Professor Caṇin nodded, awed by the coherence of his student’s thoughts. “I must concede the truth of your words, Viṣṇugupta. I would say, then, that what you call sāma is the method of the Brāhmaṇas, dāma the method of the Vaiṣyas and daṇḍa the method of the Kṣatriyas to achieve similar goals.”<br>“Not so,” said Cāṇakya, “While that characterization is elegant in its simplicity, I believe that all four of these methods are of wider applicability than you suggest. In particular, I believe the kṣatriya benefits from the adoption of all four methods. While war is often to be based on daṇḍa, the effective and lossless execution of a war must rely largely on bheda, as a war whose outcome’s truth is known in advance to both sides should never be fought. The employment of armies is primarily based on dāma; indeed, the use of daṇḍa for this purpose is known as military conscription, and is a practice of barbarians.”<br>“I must agree to this too,” said Professor Caṇin, “And in governance?”<br>“In governance too, a king who uses daṇḍa only to enforce his laws ends up inflicting punishment on the innocent and quickly becomes reviled among the people. A king who is brutal in his collection of taxes will quickly become hated among the wealthy, or may become reviled for some unintended or perceived partiality in tax collection, and men of influence will then conspire to overthrow and replace him for their own gain. Effective governance requires a combination of all four methods.”<br>The third spark.<br>That was it.<br>That was the realization.<br>fishes<br><br><br>
But when the law of punishment is kept in abeyance, it gives rise to such disorder as is implied in the proverb of fishes; for in the absence of a magistrate, the strong will swallow the weak; but under his protection, the weak resist the strong.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 1.4:13-15
<br>Politics was the basis of the reconciliation of the Bārhaspatya with the Vedic dharma. In fact it was the more general science of economics that held this role, but Cāṇakya had not yet invented this science.<br>The Bārhaspatyas had thrown out Dharma entirely claiming that its basis was in metaphysics – the question of what ought to be done depends entirely on a being’s goals and desires, they said, and thus to postulate a universal morality independent of individual goals and desires meant to postulate the existence of a universal being whose goals and desires reflected that universal morality. As such a being is not known to the senses, it does not exist, and hence they declared Dharma to be devoid of meaning.<br>But Dharma, Cāṇakya realized, did not require the existence of metaphysics, but rather emerged naturally as a consequence of men pursuing their own individual goals under a functional political system, as in such a political system righteous conduct would reward one’s Artha (wealth) and unrighteous conduct would harm it, in accordance with the principles of dāma and daṇḍa. Thus it was politics, and not metaphysics, that gave meaning to Dharma.<br>Cāṇakya identified that the fallacy of those Bārhaspatya scholars who had thrown out Dharma entirely was to define Artha too narrowly, referring only to land, cattle and gold (and also to possessions, currency, cultivation and buildings, but it was not in poetic fashion to list these). In fact it made more sense to define Artha as the sum of all human goals entirely.<br>Traditionally, Vedic philosophy listed three goals (trivarga) of human pursuit, with some schools adding the fourth (caturvarga) goal of moksha whose definition differed between schools:<br>
<br>artha (wealth) in the traditional sense
<br>kāma (pleasure), which the Bārhaspatyas had accepted as a valid human goal, and
<br>dharma (righteousness)
<br>Cāṇakya accepted this tradition, but he declared all three pursuits as incarnations of Artha, which he called the Puruṣārtha (human goals/wealth). To him Artha was fundamental, encompassing all three goals; Artha was the root and the cause of Dharma; and much as matter was comprised of dravya (substance), as consciousness was comprised of atman (self/soul), artha was the basic element that comprised all human interaction, its cause, its modes and its goals.<br>And thus as his first major achievement, eight-year-old Cāṇakya established the basis of ethics and ethical philosophy.<br>artha_alone<br><br><br>
So says Kautilya, that artha and artha alone is important, in as much as dharma and kāma depend upon artha for their realisation.

 <br><br>[date:-338|magadha,x]<br>On the Eastern bank of the Sindhu river, past impenetrable walls of stone lay a densely-populated city of over 2000 acres laid out across four caste-segregated quadrants separated by roads. Further paved roads of great breadth ran across the city in a grid-like fashion, dividing it into sixteen equal units, each serviced by numerous smaller roads of a more chaotic character.<br>Manufactories, guild housing and innumerable markets lined the busiest streets: the city was itself a center for carpentry and engineering, and goods sourced and manufactured elsewhere – metals, both precious and practical, processed; tools and devices made from them; textiles and various fabrics; clothing and blankets made of them; papers made of cotton, palm-leaf and birch-bark; perfumes and soaps; pottery and other artisan crafts; ivory and various woods and stones; spices, herbs and farm produce; animals and the equipment that pertained to them – made their way to the city’s markets through various trade routes where they would be sold for coins, cattle and cowry shells.<br>Multistorey housing was not as widespread here as it was in the Eastern cities, except among some prosperous households to whom these were a decorative luxury rather than a necessity arising from scarcity of land. Brick and stone were used more than wood here compared to the East, and while the majority of land use was residential, several facilities could be found in these residential areas. A small number of hospitals were present on the roads that divided the quadrants, and each quadrant housed its own unique facilities: the Kṣatriya quadrant was dotted by stadiums and arenas that were used for various sporting and ceremonial events; the Vaiṣya and Śūdra quadrants housed theatres and such facilities; and numerous ritual altars, stepwell reservoirs and gurukulas decorated the Brāhmaṇa quadrant.<br>This was not what made the glorious city of Takṣaśilā: this was what most prosperous cities of Vedic civilization looked like.<br>Near the city centre and bearing the banner of the Solar Emblem, was the royal palace. Excluding government offices and the royal stables and arsenals, the palace itself was under 25 acres in size, despite its splendid and luxurious appearance. To its North at the very centre of the city were four large courtyards arranged in a two-by-two grid that totalled 50 acres in land area: these lands comprised the campus of the University of Takṣaśilā.<br>One of these courtyards was fully covered in thatched roof, and contained a vast collection of manuscripts, variable in their antiquity, from all over Āryāvarta – the remaining courtyards were variously used for seated instruction, debate, sports and arts. The undecorated yet spacious thatched houses that filled the edges between the courtyards housed the Professors and the students that lodged with them; at the very central intersection of the campus was a memorial shrine to the venerated Sage Uddālaka who, four centuries prior, had migrated to the region from Ayodhya and established the university, and to the first king Dīpaṃkara, who had accepted his teachings with reverence, thus founding the kingdom as it was known.<br>This was the glorious city of Takṣaśilā.<br>But Gandhāra had many cities. From within the city you could not see much beyond its tall stone walls and some mountains in the distance. But if you were to exit the rectangular city by one of its eight doors – or by one of its many secret tunnels in case of emergencies – and cross the danger-filled waters of its moat by boat or by a lowered bridge, then cross the Sindhu river to its Western shore, then you would find yourself at Takṣaśilā’s twin city Puṣkalāvatī.<br>The seat of Persian power in Gandhāra.<br>That was a dirty little fact, which was secret to no one, yet one which nobody articulated too verbally, a stain on the very sovereignty of the Kingdom of Gandhāra.<br>Gandhāra was not an independent kingdom.<br>It had not been an independent kingdom since the Persian conquest of the Western Punjab under Darayavaush I. While the parts of Punjab to the East of Gandhāra were engaged in constant rebellion and uprisings against Persia, Gandhāra had negotiated an arrangement with the Persians that allowed them to best protect the kingdom’s policy of peace and neutrality that was necessary for the university to function.<br>Gandhāra was taxed at a lower rate than the regions to its East (but received no spending in return either), and was permitted to maintain its own laws and court rituals, and to independently enforce its own justice system without intervention from the Persian emperor. In return, the university was forced to admit a large number of Persians of noble birth as its students, and to maintain a department dedicated to those arts that Persian nobles were expected to learn. The kingdom was also required to supply the required numbers of elite Ārya infantry, cavalry and elephantry corps to the Persian army; and the university had at several points been asked to provide instruction to the imperial government to facilitate the adoption of Ārya military technologies.<br>This had been the state of affairs for the last one hundred and eighty years.<br>“Yājñapati,” Professor Ṛṣyaśṛṅga addressed his student, “What makes a man civilized, and what distinguishes a civilized man from a barbarian?”<br>“It is his precision of speech and pronunciation that makes a man civilized,” said Yājñapati. “Speaking only barbarous tongues, or incorrectly speaking the Civilized Tongue makes a man a barbarian.”<br>“But under those terms,” Cāṇakya interjected, “Most women and people of śūdra birth would be classified as barbarians, as would all unlearned people of any caste. Yet few would say it is acceptable to enslave them, or that it is unacceptable for a man to marry any woman.”<br>“Correct,” said Professor Ṛṣyaśṛṅga. “The terms civilized and barbarian cannot used to designate individuals, only tribes. And language is emphasized only insofar as it is necessary to perform rituals that require hymns, and it is the performance of these rituals that are more immediately relevant to the designation of a tribe as civilized.”<br>Cāṇakya argued further: “But there are schools of philosophy that reject the central position of ritual in religion, as well as schools that reject religion altogether. If a king were to be influenced by such a philosophy, and as a consequence cease the performance of such rituals in his court, and successfully dissuade the people of his kingdom from officiating and undertaking such rituals, will his kingdom then become barbarian? And if a Scythian chief were to start performing the correct rituals, would he then be regarded as civilized and respectable on that basis alone?”<br>“Certainly not. The correct performance of ritual requires an understanding of the ritual, which the Scythian would not possess regardless of his imitation of a civilized man. Without this understanding, a ritual becomes devoid of fruit.”<br>Then Cāṇakya opined: “I believe, Professor, that it is the adoption of correct policies in government, not correct speech in ritual, that bears fruit to a kingdom. And thus my answer to your original question: it is the imposition of correct government policies that makes a people civilized, and the imposition of incorrect policies that makes a people barbarian. When particularly harmful policies are imposed, a tribe may cease to be urban, or even become nomadic, as is observed among the Scythians. When a tribe lives under the rule of barbarians, then its own support for correct policies and the effort it makes to implement the same, are what makes it civilized.”<br>Professor Ṛṣyaśṛṅga smiled, intending to cease that conversation, and then joined it back to his own teachings on the question, which were in contrast to both Cāṇakya’s and Yājñapati’s.<br>“Indeed it is a combination of several traditions that makes a tribe civilized,” he taught, “Good laws are among them, as Cāṇakya rightly says, but so are ritual and its language, so is courtly and respectful behaviour. That is what makes the Persians civilized, even though they perform incorrect rituals in their court.”<br>This did not end the debate at all in Cāṇakya’s mind; indeed he objected to every word of that statement. For starters: “The Persians are most certainly not civilized.”<br>Professor Ṛṣyaśṛṅga gave him a stern look. “The Persians exhibit many noble qualities, and these qualities must not be neglected. Even though their court rituals are technically incorrect, they are still not as incorrect as those practised by some other tribes.”<br>“Nonetheless their people live in poverty as a result of their bad policies. Their few territories in Āryāvarta are by far the most prosperous parts of their empire. Gandhāra is the most prosperous country in their empire and the Eastern Punjab, which we regard as a relative backwater of our own civilization, contributes a third of all revenue collected by the Persian government. Such is the starkness in the difference between our prosperity and theirs, that while all their other provinces pay their tributes in silver, only we pay ours in gold.”<br>Professor Ṛṣyaśṛṅga, wishing that Cāṇakya not press further on this matter, said simply that: “Being a prosperous people, it is righteous for us to be charitable towards the Persians.”<br>“Theft is not the converse of charity — we are being punished for our wealth! Do you not see, professor? A country is not simply born with its wealth, it is policy that makes a country wealthy. It is not race that make a tribe civilized or barbarian, it is not our blood that makes us wealthier than the Persians – we are born with the same organs and all faculties as they do. Yet the policies and culture of our nations allow us to achieve greater goals than their people are allowed to by those of their nation; and when a barbarian tribe imposes its policies on a civilized one, the wealth that the latter would have created in that time frame is lost forever, it is destroyed!”<br>Professor Ṛṣyaśṛṅga found his student’s manner of arguing rather odd – not so much that he kept pressing on this matter; indeed, Ṛṣyaśṛṅga had been unable to articulate his desire to not discuss this subject, too embarrassed to say that there were subjects too taboo to be spoken of publicly in a university like Takṣaśilā – but he felt genuine discomfort in Cāṇakya’s desire to repeatedly circle the argument back to the matter of wealth and wealth alone.<br>“Is wealth all that matters to you, Cāṇakya? What about charity? The service of the aged? The keeping to duties and oaths?”<br>“Wealth is all that matters, Professor,” said Cāṇakya. “The keeping of oaths is desirable precisely to instill trust among creditors, and charity, service of the aged – these are only achievable through wealth. Indeed, the very cause for charity is the desirable goal that is the elimination of poverty, that is, the lack of wealth.”<br>artha_alone<br><br><br>
So says Kautilya, that artha and artha alone is important, in as much as dharma and kāma depend upon artha for their realisation.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 1.7:6-7
<br>Word of Cāṇakya’s debate with Professor Ṛṣyaśṛṅga, and his foul words for the Achaemenid dynasty soon caught the attention of Vištāspa, a student from a prominent Persian noble family which enjoyed a position quite close to the Imperial throne.<br>Vištāspa knew better than to complain to his parents about such events at the university. They would hardly find a single student’s offensive words to be worth fighting a political battle over – no, that would not be worth their status. That was the nature of battle as he understood it – a warrior of high status did not prove his worth by fighting many battles, or by killing many enemy soldiers in battle; he proved his worth by picking crucial battles, and by killing enemy targets of importance.<br>A warrior of high status expected his loyal subordinates to fight minor battles for him, and in this case, he was the loyal subordinate to his parents.<br>The nine-year-old Cāṇakya was found in the Library of Takṣaśilā, his eyes scouring over a manuscript on battlefield formations, and in his hands another manuscript on siege warfare.<br>Surrounded by two minions, Vištāspa approached him.<br>“Cāṇakya!” he cried, attempting to modulate his voice to a cold tone and register to elicit the desired feeling of fear from the younger boy. “I wish to speak with you. Would this be an appropriate time?”<br>Without looking up from his book, Cāṇakya asked: “How much of my time do you wish for?”<br>Vištāspa ignored him. “My name is Vištāspa. I heard of what you said about the Persians, and wish to converse with you on this matter.”<br>“I am glad that you have an interest in improving your government’s policy,” said Cāṇakya, looking cheery. “And I am willing to provide you any instruction you desire in the relevant sciences.”<br>“You should know that the Persian empire does not tolerate such blasphemy against the throne.” Vištāspa’s words were silky. “Say what you wish to say about the king of Gandhāra, that is up to your provincial ruler to handle. But you are a Persian subject, and must behave as such towards the emperor.”<br>“Indeed, that is among the laws that causes me to regard you as barbarians.” Cāṇakya stood up, folding his hands sarcastically as he prepared to leave.<br>Whether it was those words, or the attitude with which Cāṇakya mocked the prince of Persia, this seemed to greatly incense Ariyāramna, one of the aforementioned minions, for he then angrily shoved Cāṇakya towards the ground.<br>Cāṇakya pulled himself back up. “Lay another finger on me,” he warned most icily, “And I will break it off.”<br>Ariyāramna did so.<br>Cāṇakya did so.<br>divided_rule<br><br><br>
Of divided rule and foreign rule, divided rule, or rule of a country by two kings, perishes owing to mutual hatred, partiality and rivalry. My teacher says that foreign rule which depends upon its winning the affection of the people is for the enjoyment of others in its own condition.
No, says Kauṭilya: divided rule between father and son or between two brothers has similar consequences and is under the clutches of a minister. But foreign rule brought into existence by seizing the country from its king still alive thinks that the country is not its own, impoverishes it and carries off its wealth, or treats it as a commercial article; and when the country ceases to love it, it retires, abandoning the country.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 8.2:5-8
<br>Cāṇakya found it frustrating that despite the eloquence in his manner of speaking on academic subjects and in debate, he still had no idea how to behave when being disciplined by a teacher. Vištāspa, Ariyāramna and himself had been summoned to the Head Professor’s workspace, where Professor Caṇin had also been invited. Currently, the Head Professor was saying something about discipline and violence.<br>At last, Cāṇakya found his voice.<br>“Professor. I believe the issue of my being assaulted over the thoughts I expressed is of far greater significance than that of me employing violence in defence of myself.”<br>“You will not continue to defend your actions,” said the Head Professor, “and indeed you will no longer express any ill thoughts you may have about the Persian government, its people or its traditions. It is forbidden.”<br>“You cannot forbid—”<br>“The punishment will be expulsion.”<br>Cāṇakya looked helplessly towards Professor Caṇin, but the latter’s face betrayed no sympathy either.<br>“And Vištāspa,” said the Head Professor, “There is little that I can reprimand Ariyāramna over, as he is here in your service, and so you must decide the manner in which you discipline him. You must learn to control your friends, and to restrain them when they act in a way that is beneath their dignity.”<br>“Forgive him, Professor,” said Vištāspa, “He is simply loyal to the Empire and to its throne, as I am, and sometimes this feeling of loyalty overrides his better senses.”<br>The Head Professor continued: “And while princes at your age enjoy the euphoria of fighting, especially if they can justify it with a cause like loyalty or honor – I assure you that this is precisely the sort of matter that your father would not wish to hear of, or to see escalated to the level of politics.”<br>“I understand, Professor,” Vištāspa agreed, “And Cāṇakya, I regret the pain and humiliation that my dear friend caused you by treating you in such manner in a public place. I do, however, wish that you had responded in a more appropriate manner to his slight aggression.”<br>Both professors were staring at him expectantly, so Cāṇakya said through gritted teeth: “I ask for your forgiveness.”<br>Vištāspa made a concillatory gesture. “You will see, Cāṇakya, that the Persians are a very big-hearted people.”<br>Cāṇakya resisted the urge to ask: Do you wish me to garland him as my wife as well? Or perhaps I ought to touch lips with him out of respect for that Persian custom?<br>“You may leave now, Vištāspa,” said the Head Professor. “Cāṇakya, stay.”<br>destroy_enemy<br><br><br>
My teacher says that in an open war, both sides suffer by sustaining a heavy loss of men and money; and that even the king who wins a victory will appear as defeated in consequence of the loss of men and money. No, says Kautilya, even at considerable loss of men and money, the destruction of an enemy is desirable.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 7.13:31-33
<br>“What was that, Professor?” Cāṇakya asked with indignance, then looked at Professor Caṇin. “And you too? That vulture-feed dared to attack me, and you discipline me for raising my hand in self-defence?”<br>“We live under the mercy of the Persians, Cāṇakya,” said the Head Professor. “And as long as this is true, we must live under their rules as well, if we wish to live at all.”<br>“What use is a life of apology?” spat Cāṇakya, then stopped, realizing he didn’t quite mean those words.<br>The Head Professor took his leave, allowing Professor Caṇin to speak with his student.<br>“There are two matters that we must first settle before we address the matter of true importance,” Professor Caṇin announced, “First, here is the truth of the whole debacle of barbarians and the civilized. These terms have nothing to do with wealth, nor to do with the various features of a culture that Professor Ṛṣyaśṛṅga listed—”<br>Cāṇakya raised his finger in objection, but Caṇin continued.<br>“—Every known culture has a notion of civilized and barbarian, and classifies the cultures furthest from itself geographically, that is, outside some circle beyond its own boundary, as barbarian. This is motivated by nothing but the natural necessity of men to have an enemy, in order to allow themselves to believe there is something they must protect. It is possible – although also not permitted for you – for one to argue on the policies taken by the Persian government without referring to them as barbarians. Doing so only serves to satisfy this aforementioned emotional need. That is the truth of the matter, and all else is an attempt to base these arbitrary feelings in some rational cause that does not exist.”<br>Cāṇakya needed some time to process this fully.<br>Caṇin went on. “Indeed, if a Persian student came to you expressing his agreement with your more specific criticisms of the Persian empire, even as he continued to follow traditional Persian rituals, I believe you would then yourself refrain from referring to him as vulture-feed, and may even feel shame at your previous use of that term. These are words suited for a battlefield for a commander in need of raising his soldiers’ spirits by instilling anger at the enemy; they are not suitable at a university campus.”<br>Cāṇakya opened his mouth to speak, but Caṇin held out a hand. “I will not entertain any further debate on this matter, even privately. Not because it is too taboo to speak on, but because I believe that you do not truly have any sensible point of disagreement with my words, and will only argue in order to save face by seeking a concession from me on some matter of little importance. If after two days of peace you still have some objection to what I have expressed, you may then again privately meet with me for debate.<br>“Second: you asked why I disciplined you more harshly than I did Vištāspa and Ariyāramna. I will say this much: if a child is seen to be fighting with his playmate, his mother will discipline him regardless of who initiated the fight or who may be held guilty if the matter were taken to legal arbitrage, because she wishes to better her child, and holds no sway over the playmate that isn’t her own.”<br>“I never held any appreciation for that argument, even when it was made to me by my own mother,” said Cāṇakya, “But on that same line of reasoning, the mother also makes provisions to protect her child from the dangers his playmate may cause him in future, or to simply prevent them from interacting. Vištāspa and his minions are likely to continue to create nuisances in my way, and what you have done is deny me any means of defending myself or punishing him.”<br>This response made Professor Caṇin’s expression turn very grave, as if they were finally speaking of a matter of true importance.<br>“That brings me to the main topic I wish to discuss with you, Viṣṇugupta. What, precisely, would you have done if we had not forbidden you from speaking against the Persian government?”<br>Cāṇakya stared.<br>“To say that you would have fought, against Vištāspa or indeed against the Persian government itself, is insufficient. What would you have done about all the consequences of such actions? Here would have been the consequences of your actions if hot-headed, indignant boys like you had populated the ranks of this university and of the government of Gandhāra. First, Vištāspa, to save his honor among his peers at Takṣaśilā, would escalate the matter to his own father. His father would then demand an audience with the King of Gandhāra. Then the King of Gandhāra, if he were also similar in manner to you, would refuse to comply, at which Vištāspa’s father would submit an exaggerated and indignant report to the Emperor about the state of Persia-Gandhāra relations. Then the Emperor of Persia would summon the King of Gandhāra to his court, and subsequently when the king refuses to interfere in the matters of the university, order his replacement. If all the influential houses within Gandhāra’s government were also of your nature and outlook, they would refuse and proclaim their loyalty to the King of Gandhāra, at which the Persian Emperor would send his enormous army to the walls of Takṣaśilā. Loyal to their king and country, the armies of Gandhāra will defend the city against an army that hopelessly outnumbers them, fighting till their last breaths. Gandhāra will be denied the special treatment it has been receiving so far – to the contrary, the armies of Persia will reduce Takṣaśilā to flour, massacre our scholars, and burn every last manuscript in the library.”<br>Cāṇakya’s throat felt dry.<br>If there were a hymn in the Vedas whose purpose was to utterly humiliate the addressee, this would have been its source text.<br>It destroyed his pride to hear these words. To hear that his professor considered him so foolish and rash, and rightfully so. To hear that he would have in his irresponsibility, for what now seemed so petty a purpose, caused the destruction of what was perhaps the last great center for Vedic civilization. To hear how pathetically impotent the glorious kingdom of Gandhāra was at defending itself.<br>But most terribly of all, to have the fact reaffirmed that he wasn’t free to speak.<br>For any commoner, this desire quite probably seemed alien, for it was a feeling that could only be shared by a man who had ever had an original thought of his own, who had ever had something to say that was worth saying. Yet the fulfilment of this desire was an unstatably obvious goal among the Brāhmaṇas.<br>Cāṇakya had forever sought to pursue truth as the noblest goal, he had always held nothing to be more sacred than it, and had believed that to kill a thought was to point a sword to the neck of the Goddess Sarasvati herself. And now he was being asked to censor himself, to hold more sacred than the truth an emperor's scepter.<br>He would have expressed these thoughts in as many words, but Professor Caṇin seemed to read his mind.<br>“It is a tightrope to tread for a Brāhmaṇa with political ambitions,” he said, “For it is the truth and truth alone that a scholar must seek – and yet it is upon precisely these men to employ deception and strategy to achieve their political goals, for it is their intellect upon which all strategy rests. If you do pursue a career in politics, Viṣṇugupta, you will learn that you will not only need to omit the truth, but also to lie, to betray the truth in order to serve it.<br>“Āryāvarta lies divided between two empires of darkness: the Persians on the West and the Magadhas on the East, leaving in between only some militant confederacies of the Punjab and the ancient land of the Kurus that no longer retains its former glory. In Gandhāra we pretend, out of fear of consequences, that it is only the Magadhas are objectionable, that the Persians allow us to be free and to maintain our own rules. But as these events demonstrate, as my own prohibition on you demonstrates, Gandhāra is not free. The Vedic way of life, the culture of scholarship in which no sentence is unspeakable and no thought blasphemous, is dying out under the Persians in more ways than you too are aware.<br>“It is not merely change that is needed, but a revolution. You have the capacity to lead this revolution, Viṣṇugupta; yet there is much that you need to learn first. I will quote back to you a sentence that you spoke earlier this year in one of my classes, which impressed me greatly: a war whose outcome’s truth is known in advance to both sides should never be fought. Yet those are the sorts of wars that spirited princes spend their lives fighting: in pursuit of victories that serve only to be undone shortly after, victories that even when in effect changed nothing but the symbol of a flag on a fortress, victories that will never distinguish their name in history. These princes have spirit, but no ambition.<br>“You, on the other hand, Viṣṇugupta – I believe that you were born for greatness. If you seek to cause a true revolution, whose effects will be long-lasting, then you cannot act in the manner of such princes. You must learn to rise above ideals like honour and dignity, and to fight for an actual goal. You must learn to identify this goal and understand what it means to achieve this goal, to learn the difference between fighting and winning.”<br>And at last Professor Caṇin said those words that would one day come to define Cāṇakya’s life, that would for centuries forth become synonymous with his very name:<br>“You must learn the art of cunning.”<br>hero<br><br><br>
The self-controlled and vehement hero (Dhīroddhata) is altogether dominated by pride and jealousy, wholly devoted to magic practices and deceit, self-assertive, fickle, irascible and boastful.
—Dhanañjaya, in the Daśarūpaka, 2.5
<br>A month and a fortnight later, the Persian emperor visited Puṣkalāvatī on a diplomatic occasion.<br>Each Persian family in the city paid its respects to the emperor with various exotic and expensive gifts.<br>Ātarepāta too gracefully presented to the emperor his gift: a particularly rare breed of parrot, which, according to the merchant who had sold it, sourced from the Eastern sea trade. Such opportunities to ingratiate one’s family with the Emperor were rare, and Ātarepāta regarded himself as fortunate for the opportunity.<br>“My son himself taught it praises of you, Emperor,” his wife added helpfully with a smile, their son nodding in agreement. “When you want to hear your praises, Emperor, just say: Xšāyaθiya Xšāyaθiyānām.”<br>Parrots were always a treasured bird in Persia, but this was a different parrot from any common one – its colours looked almost as if they had been painted on. Ātarepāta had no trouble at all in believing all the claims that the merchant had made of it. He was quite fortunate indeed, to have found such a unique gift for the Emperor at such an opportune time.<br>“Xšāyaθiya Xšāyaθiyānām,” said the Emperor’s bard.<br>And then the parrot said:<br>“Darayavahauš is the most exalted of his dynasty!—like a one-eyed man among the blind! Like a pig among rats!”<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>(DEAD SILENCE)<br>“ … ”<br>Ātarepāta did not so much as dare to raise his eyes lest it meet the Emperor’s.<br>“That … that must be a mistake!” he blurted frantically. “We did not teach him that, Emperor, I swear it— and, see, there are many more praises: Xšāyaθiya Xšāyaθiyānām!”<br>The parrot said:<br>“Every generation, the dynasty of Haxāmaniš halves in intellect and splendor! The Emperor is bad enough, but I would rather be ruled by a dead eunuch than by his idiot son!”<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>“NO— oh Xšāyaθiya Xšāyaθiyānām, there has been a mistake, I swear it Xšāyaθiya Xšāyaθiyānām! This must not be my parrot, Xšāyaθiya Xšāyaθiyānām! Or perhaps all parrots of this breed are like this, I had bought it thinking it was special, but not in this way Xšāyaθiya Xšāyaθiyānām!”<br>The parrot said:<br>“MAYBE WE SHOULD MAKE HIS IDIOT SON A DEAD EUNUCH!”<br>“THAT IS CORRECT. IF WE GROW CLOSE TO THE EMPEROR, THEN KILL ALL HIS SONS, MAYBE OUR SON VIŠTĀSPA CAN BE THE NEXT EMPEROR!”<br>“THE DYNASTY OF HAXĀMANIŠ WILL END. OUR SON WILL BE EMPEROR.”<br>“YES, I WILL BE!”<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>Ātarepāta watched in horror, as the Xšāyaθiya Xšāyaθiyānām – the King of Kings – raised his finger, and pointed, not at him, but at his son.<br>NO, he tried to scream, but no words would come out.<br>“Make him a eunuch,” said the Emperor, his voice smooth as the fabrics that came out of Kaśmīra. “And then kill him. Kill every single member of this rotten family – one, by, one – in front of one another’s eyes.”<br>“Yes, Xšāyaθiya Xšāyaθiyānām,” said an attendant dutifully, then bit his tongue—<br>“KILLING THE EMPEROR’S SONS! KILLING THEM ONE-BY-ONE ONCE THE OLD MAN IS DEAD! I LOVE KILLING THE EMPEROR’S SONS!” (the parrot said)<br>“AND KILL THAT HELLBORN BIRD!”<br>(Somewhere in the crowd, among the delegation from Takṣaśila, Professor Caṇin looked exasperatedly at that Cāṇakya boy, who wore the most innocent of looks as he stared idly at the parrot flying in the air as the Persian archers tried, to no avail, to shoot it down.<br>“It’s such a tragedy,” Cāṇakya said to those whocould hear it. “Vištāspa was such a brave young prince. Upheld the honour of his race, willing to stand up even—to me! And now, his entire family is dead. Why do the best among us meet the most terrible fates?”)]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/1/1.2.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/1/1.2.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 14:27:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[1.3]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Whoever possesses enough experience of the world and its affairs may, through the influence of an interested friend, seek the favour of a king who is endowed with amiable qualities and is possessed of all the elements of sovereignty. He may court the favour of any king provided he thinks: Just as I am in need of a patron, so is this king possessed of a taste for good advice and is of amiable character. He may even court the favour of such a king as is poor and destitute of the elements of sovereignty, but never, of such a one as is of a depraved character: whoever, as a king, is destitute of good temper and amiable character cannot, by reason of his habitual hatred of the science of polity and an inborn proclivity to evil ways, maintain his sovereignty, though he is possessed of immense sovereign power.
Having obtained admittance to an amiable king, he shall give the king instructions in sciences. Absence of contradiction from the king will render his position secure. When his opinion is sought about present or future schemes needing much thought and consideration, he may boldly and sensibly, and with no fear of contradiction from the assembly of ministers, pronounce his opinion so as to be in harmony with the principles of righteousness and economy. When required, he may answer questions on points of righteousness and economy.

<br>[date:-336|magadha,x]<br>Today was the day.<br>For centuries forth, the people of all Āryāvarta would look back upon this iconic day as the day that the wicked Dhanānanda was shown the light; as the day that the eleven-year-old boy from Takṣaśilā would become the most powerful man in Āryāvarta and use that power to introduce the masses to unprecedented levels of wealth; as the day that Mathura would conquer her conquerors, spreading far and wide the light of the Vedas and of the Arthaśāstra.<br>Cāṇakya was sure of it.<br>(But no one has ever meaningfully advised the throne of Magadha and come out of it alive! one girl, the youngling of a chief of mercenary corporations, had cried at him—to which he had said:<br>No one had ventured beyond the Northern mountains! – until the Uttara-Kurus did it. And now every merchant does it.<br>No one had discovered the knowledge of the science of polity! – until Bṛhaspati did it. And now every student does it.<br>No one had run a yojana in under a ghaṭi – and now every athlete does it.)<br>It had been four years since Cāṇakya had first been admitted to Takṣaśilā, and in those four years Cāṇakya had unified Bārhaspatya philosophy with Vedic ethics, discovered and formulated the field of economics, composed the first draft of what would be his magnus opus, the Arthaśāstra (lit. Science of Wealth; Economics), and formulated the master plan for his revolution.<br>That was more than most students would achieve in a lifetime or seven.<br>Cāṇakya thought he ought to be allowed his own gurukula at this point. The only hindrance against getting one at the age of eleven was that the traditional ceremony to graduate from studenthood was called “marriage”.<br>As the first part of his master plan, he had requested an audience with the Magadhi Emperor Dhanānanda. Prime Minister Sakadala, apparently intrigued by the young Cāṇakya, had approved this meeting; his head held high and proud, Cāṇakya had arrived in Pāṭaliputra, the capital city of Magadha.<br>He had to admit: Pāṭaliputra was a great city. Cāṇakya had stopped at several metropolises on the crumbling Northern Highway on his fortnight-long journey, and Indraprastha, the stronghold of the Ārjunāyanas, was the last worthy city he’d seen. Mathura, more than half-empty due to massacre and abandonment – Kauśāmbi, which the armies of Magadha had turned into an article for their enjoyment for as long as they had camped in that kingdom – Kāśī, which had once been completely wiped out by Ajātaśatru over a dowry dispute, and whose recovery remained weak as a result of Magadha’s excessive taxation.<br>But the Magadha capital itself was well-planned, well-fortified and not too dissimilar from Takṣaśilā in order – and more enormous than the mind could imagine.<br>“The Emperor and Prime Minister are currently occupied in the audience of a wrestling match in the arena,” said the female attendant. The boy was certainly too young to be offered the traditional pleasures of hospitality, so she just said: “You may rest in the royal courtroom while you await them.”<br>Cāṇakya strode into the courtroom without stopping by any of the surrounding chairs, headed straight towards the currently unoccupied throne—<br>—and without so much ceremony, placed himself down on the throne.<br>Never in her life, nor in any real or fictional story of gossip had Rohiṇī ever observed such a startling display of insolence – had she been of slightly weaker stead, she would have likely fainted in shock. Instead, she composed herself and in a scramble of urgency took another chair from the front row and brought it before Cāṇakya.<br>Cāṇakya placed his bag on that chair without another look, then added: “Ask the king to abandon his current shenanigans; this is a matter of far greater importance.”<br>This time Rohiṇī did feel a little light-headed.<br>When Cāṇakya merely placed his water pitcher on the next chair, Rohiṇī pointed weakly at the seat that Cāṇakya had taken, finding her voice at last: “That’s the Emperor’s throne … most venerable guest.”<br>Cāṇakya simply nodded. It was kind of her, he thought, to be so concerned, but Cāṇakya knew of the emperor’s low birth already, and did not find that bothersome at all. “I’m not too concerned with rituals of caste and purity,” he said with a smile, “And in any case I’m sure your emperor is also venerable in his own right.”<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>“Maidservant,” said a most well-mannered voice, “What is happening?”<br>It was a young boy to whom the voice belonged, at most a year older than Cāṇakya. Flanked by his two minions and dressed in colourful royal robes, the kid was most obviously a prince. His face seemed more bemused than offended.<br>Rohiṇī, on the other hand, had turned completely pale in horror.<br>“Forgive me, prince Pabbata!” she cried, willing herself not to stutter. “I tried to ask him, he doesn’t seem to understand—”<br>Pabbata silenced her with a curt gesture, then walked up to Cāṇakya. “If you sit on his throne, Father will consider that a declaration of war against him and have you beheaded—”<br>Cāṇakya promptly raised himself off the throne and walked down the steps of the elevated platform that held it.<br>“—that is why this kind young lady was asking you to vacate it; she did not wish for you to be misunderstood so.”<br>Suppressing his shock and terror, Cāṇakya asked: “If I wished to declare war against your father, why wouldn’t I just say that? Why would I come to Pāṭaliputra and sit on his chair?” For that matter, why couldn’t the servant just express her wish in words? He had heard that many Magadhas were illiterate, but apparently they were also unfamiliar with language, preferring to express themselves using some rituals with chairs.<br>“I see that you have not been trained in court manners,” Pabbata commented, “Or perhaps such manners are different in … where are you from?”<br>“Takṣaśilā,” Cāṇakya said. “And yes, I would not expect the King of Gandhāra to be so offended if I were to sit on his throne. Indeed he would feel quite honored to have his seat graced by a man of such brilliant knowledge and scholarship as myself.”<br>Pabbata and Cāṇakya introduced themselves to each other, and Cāṇakya told the prince what he intended to speak with the emperor about – at which Pabbata announced that he wished to speak privately with his guest; once Pabbata’s minions and Rohiṇī had left the courtroom, Pabbata started to look very serious.<br>“In this case, Cāṇakya,” he said, “I must advise you against dealing with father at all.”<br>Cāṇakya raised an eyebrow, and Pabbata turned slowly, looking over each shoulder carefully to ensure that no one was listening. “What I say to you is in confidence, and you may not repeat them to anyone. Do I have your word?” And then without really waiting for Cāṇakya’s response, he continued:<br>“My father is hardly like his own father. My grandfather Mahāpadma enacted various changes in the administration of Magadha, changes that I believe would have been to your liking, seeing that you are a Brāhmaṇa of Gandhāra. When Mahāpadma seized the throne, it was he who appointed Sakadala as his Prime Minister, who made efforts to assimilate the conquered territories into Magadha, and who ceased the previous dynasties’ practice of burning down cities for sport. My father has only tolerated Sakadala so far because he is too used to his presence and is too lazy to remove him; he does not care the least about such changes as what you might propose.”<br>Cāṇakya took half a minute to absorb this.<br>At last he asked: “What does your father care about, then?”<br>Pabbata merely shrugged. “Wine? Women? Truly, I do not think my father cares about very much at all, and he certainly lacks the will to implement any changes you may suggest – once again, quite unlike his own father who had made such an elaborate effort to capture the throne for himself and then continued to dedicate himself to the administration of Pāṭaliputra.”<br>Cāṇakya found it laughable that Pabbata thought of Mahāpadma’s administration as some sort of bygone golden age. It was under Mahāpadma that Mathura and Ujjain had been razed, and under him that many ancient noble lines of Āryāvarta had been exterminated. His conquest of Pāṭaliputra had hardly ushered in an era of peace and stability, but was merely one in a long sequence of assassinations and coups. Cāṇakya himself could already imagine fourteen different methods by which he could assassinate Dhanānanda that very day, as Dhanānanda had assassinated Mahāpadma before him, but it would be pointless to do so without training a suitable replacement: Dhanānanda would merely be replaced by another ruinous king, and in at least nine of those fourteen methods, Cāṇakya would be caught.<br>So instead of saying Your father’s father was also an idiot, your entire family and all the other clans of Magadha are idiots, Cāṇakya chose to say:<br>“This is not to deny the significance of Emperor Mahāpadma’s many achievements, but the reforms that I propose are of a far more radical nature than simply not burning down cities for sport.”<br>“And that is precisely why you shouldn’t express them to Father,” Pabbata smiled sadly. “I do not know how, precisely, you will extract yourself from this situation, but I will tell you this: you ought to find a more receptive individual for your advice than Father.”<br>Cāṇakya considered this.<br>He did not quite accept what Pabbata had told him – after all, Pabbata apparently considered Mahāpadma to have been an ideal ruler, and there was clearly a lot of internal family politics that motivated Pabbata’s words. Pabbata was Dhanānanda’s youngest prince and traditional succession in Magadha was one of primogeniture; his last sentence was likely a subtle invitation for future political alliance – which also raised the question of why Pabbata would trust Cāṇakya so much, or care so much for his future political support, as to speak so freely with him about his father.<br>Nonetheless, Cāṇakya decided that he would be at his very politest in Dhanānanda’s presence, at least for today.<br>restraint<br><br><br>
Hence by overthrowing the aggregate of the six vices, [a saintly king] shall restrain the organs of sense; acquire wisdom by keeping company with the aged; see through his spies; establish safety and security by being ever active; maintain his subjects in the observance of their respective duties by exercising authority; keep up his personal discipline by receiving lessons in the sciences; and endear himself to the people by bringing them in contact with wealth and doing good to them.
Thus with his organs of sense under his control, he shall keep away from hurting the women and property of others; avoid not only lustfulness, even in dream, but also falsehood, haughtiness, and evil proclivities; and keep away from unrighteous and uneconomical transactions.
Not violating righteousness and economy, he shall enjoy his desires. He shall never be devoid of happiness. He may enjoy in an equal degree the three pursuits of life: righteousness, wealth, and desire, which are inter-dependent upon each other. Any one of these three, when enjoyed to an excess, hurts not only the other two, but also itself.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 1.7:1-5
<br>When the Emperor did arrive, it was four hours late, intoxicated and only after repeated prompting, first by his Prime Minister, then by Pabbata through his mother (for Pabbata did not wish his own name to be stained in his father’s mind by Cāṇakya’s invariable impending disappointment or by the blood of his likely subsequent execution), then finally by a brave attendant who he kicked to the ground in rage.<br>He walked up to his throne (at which Cāṇakya became very glad that the Emperor was late, or he may have found his seat unexpectedly warm), collapsed onto it, and said through closed eyes:<br>“I hope you brought something interesting for me, Brāhmaṇa child. I have only just executed a wrestler and two dancers who didn’t sufficiently capture my intrigue, and you would not wish to add your own name to that list.”<br>That was hardly a well-boding start, and the sermon that Cāṇakya had earlier prepared no longer seemed likely to bear fruit. Thus Cāṇakya quickly improvised.<br>“Great King,” the boy said, his tone formal, “I do believe I have something to offer you that will intrigue you more than even the most ferocious wrestler or the most skilful acrobat. You may have met many teachers who preach to you ideals like charity and virtuous conduct without justifying what its benefit is to you. Instead, I will only teach you of your own goals, of how you may effectively pursue and achieve them, and how I may aid you in the pursuit of these goals.”<br>As he spoke these words, Dhanānanda’s expression shifted from one of mere disinterest to being positively offended.<br>“Ah!” he cried, smiling exaggeratedly, “I see! So you claim to be a better knower and director of my own wants than I am. How very interesting!”<br>Cāṇakya had to force himself to talk sweetly, to rephrase every thought of his to a form that he could realistically hope would not excessively offend the king. He would pretend to sympathize with the king’s vilest actions for now, and slowly, once he secured a position at the royal court use that position to mould the king’s thoughts and behavior until it was sufficiently righteous …<br>“Great King, many come to your court claiming that they seek to serve you, yet in truth they only seek to serve their own agendas, their own beliefs about what is virtuous and what is not. I swear to you, to drop all such pretenses and to speak to you honestly on the matter of the policies and decisions you make as emperor, and what their true consequences will be. If you would so permit, I would like to engage in a dialogue of questioning with you in order to offer you a taste of what my service would be as your courtier—”<br>Cāṇakya wasn’t sure which part it was that elicited this response, but by the end of his speaking, Dhanānanda’s eyes had turned icy, and even his fake smile was gone. When a voice was finally heard in response, it was not the emperor’s, but Prime Minister Sakadala’s.<br>“You dare suggest questioning the emperor, child?”<br>The Emperor and his Prime Minister continued to stare at the boy, their eyes offended and hateful.<br>And that was when Cāṇakya realized that his cause was utterly, completely, hopeless.<br>That was when all the idealistic daydreams of bringing about a golden age as Dhanānanda’s advisor left him.<br>That was when he realized what sort of a fool he had been.<br>Even if by some trickery Cāṇakya managed to secure a position in the Magadhi court – not only would Cāṇakya be unable to have any influence in Magadhi administration, such a life would be ruinous to Cāṇakya’s very soul. Life in service of such a ruler would be all but a physical impossibility.<br>No, Pabbata had been speaking the truth – the goal was now no longer a position at Dhanānanda’s court, but to safely extract himself out of the situation that he had placed himself in. Yet if he was correct in his assessment of the emperor’s character, merely asking for forgiveness and offering to go separate ways would hardly accomplish that goal. Instead, he would need to continue playing the role he had assumed until some opportunity arose … to flatter the emperor in a way that would cause the emperor to dismiss him in humour, or with some reward, or with only minor punishment.<br>“I request your forgiveness for the misunderstanding,” Cāṇakya said quickly. “I did not mean questioning in the sense of interrogation, nor a scholastic examination, I meant merely an intellectual exercise in which I would demonstrate the generality of the methods I propose to whatever goals and desires the emperor may have. The point I would have then demonstrated was that all goals could be achieved through wealth, and I would have described to you policies for the maximal creation of wealth.”<br>“And are there any kings in history who enacted such policies?” Prime Minister Sakadala asked, “Whose names you would like to quote to the Emperor?”<br>There was the opportunity.<br>“I believe that Emperor Dhanānanda has the potential to exceed all such kings of history. With the expansive territory and wealth that you rule over, O Great King, every step you take has far greater an impact on the nations of the world than the entire lifespans of any king of history.”<br>The emperor gave him a very pretentious smile.<br>“And why, again, do you wish to have a role in that impact that I have?” he questioned. “Ah, yes, because you believe your intervention in my governance will benefit me.”<br>Dhanānanda sat up straighter, suddenly looking as if he had never been drunk. “You know, Minister,” he said with a sneer towards Sakadala, “The arrogance of the Brāhmaṇas never ceases to amaze me – is it that you believe that my father, and indeed all the previous ruling houses of Magadha were all so incompetent that we need your advice, or do you believe that it is I who am so uniquely incompetent that I need your advice?”<br>Cāṇakya was truly at a loss for words.<br>The emperor made a clicking sound in his mouth, shaking his head rapidly. “Oh, no, it’s neither, isn’t it, sweet-talking child? You believe that I have the capacity to exceed all of them! Why? Am I not my father’s son? Do you also wish to call me a bastard child, boy?”<br>With one look towards the muscular guard who stood at his throne’s side, he made the universal gesture of off-with-his-head.<br>self-protection<br><br><br>
Self-protection shall be the first and constant thought of a wise man; for the life of a man under the service of a king is aptly compared to life in fire; whereas fire burns a part or the whole of the body, if at all, the king has the power either to destroy or to advance the whole family, consisting of sons and wives, of his servants.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 5.4:16-17
<br>And that was when Cāṇakya began to panic.<br>That was when the true gravity of the situation into which he had placed himself began to impress itself in his mind, and he started racing through his mind in search for some solution, some method of escape or to otherwise save his life. Instead, his brain continually returned images of Professor Caṇin’s warnings and all that he had read and heard about Magadha’s barbarism, of the repeated rationalizations he had made in his wishful thinking. The best his mind could come up with was to run with his legs as fast as he could, a solution which was overridden by the rational part of his mind that reminded him that he could not outrun horses, nor arrows, nor the sound of a conch shell.<br>It was Pabbata who came to his rescue.<br>“Father,” he said with utmost politeness, “While I applaud your decisiveness in awarding an on-the-spot execution, I believe that there may be cause for further deliberation with respect to the precise punishment awarded to this particular offender, and thus a more standard scheduled execution may be more suitable. Consider it a request from your loyal son.”<br>Dhanānanda looked surprised, but made a conciliatory gesture.<br>“Two days,” he said, then stood up. “I give you two days for your deliberations, son. After that, I will no longer entertain your offensive client.”]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/1/1.3.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/1/1.3.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 14:20:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[1.4]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>bad_country<br><br><br>
Do not inhabit a country where you are not respected, cannot earn your livelihood, have no friends, or cannot acquire knowledge.
Do not stay for a single day where there are not these five persons: a wealthy man, a Brāhmaṇa well versed in Vedic lore, a king, a river and a physician.
Wise men should never go into a country where there are no means of earning wealth, where the people have no dread of anybody, have no sense of shame, no intelligence, or a charitable disposition.
—Kautilya, according to the Cāṇakya Nītiśāstra
<br>Two years ago, upon his altercation with the Persian prince, Professor Caṇin had advised him to learn the art of cunning. A year before that, he himself had formulated the doctrine of sāma dāma daṇḍa bheda – persuasion, purchase, punishment and deceit. To learn these methods, and to learn when to employ each method, was the art of cunning.<br>Over these two years, he had repeatedly won debates against opponents, from students to professors to nobles and other interested parties, who were initially convinced of viewpoints most opposed to his own, and he had converted them to the truth. He had done so without uttering a single lie, without a single line of argument that was not based in reason, without the use of emotion or of any form of manipulation.<br>Public debates were the most high-status events that the university held, and the courtyards in which they were held would be populated by visitors from other gurukulas, as well as by nobles and other wealthy men who sought to signal that they were well-versed in the sciences. But to hear Cāṇakya speak, even girls and peasant children, who had neither intention nor opportunity of ever pursuing an academic education, would gather past the university’s fences, wide-eyed in awe at his scholarly eloquence.<br>Such was the nature of Cāṇakya’s words – he made no effort to make them less erudite to be accessible to such audiences, yet he also made no effort to make them erudite beyond necessity out of a desire to impress more scholarly audiences.<br>And as a consequence Cāṇakya had grown so confident in the effectiveness of sāma, of persuasion alone, that his mind had become almost unable to imagine a man who couldn’t be convinced by the truth. Particularly instrumental in building this confidence in him had been his debate with Śrībhānu, a Magadhi kṣatriya student who was heavily influenced by a philosopher of his country contemporary to Ajātaśatru.<br>“Ambition is the cause of all suffering,” Śrībhānu had said, “Hence my objection to your position that the pursuit of wealth is the noblest goal.”<br>“I deny your premise,” Cāṇakya had replied, to which Śrībhānu had explained:<br>“It is his desire for wealth that causes a man to be unhappy in its absence; it is his desire for family that causes him to be unhappy in their death; it is his desire for women that causes him to be unhappy in abstinence. It is the mark of maturity to reject all such desires and ambitions, that is the principle of ascetism.”<br>To which Cāṇakya had said simply: “Then die.”<br>At Śrībhānu’s offended expression, he had elaborated: “Why? Do you desire life? Surely it is the desire for life that causes a man to be unhappy at the prospect of death.”<br>“I have no attachments towards life either,” Śrībhānu had said indignantly. “But I also do not desire death.”<br>“So you have no preference between life and death?”<br>“Correct.”<br>“And did you have any preference between life and death yesterday?”<br>“I did not.”<br>“And the day before?”<br>“I did not.”<br>“In all the days since your conversion to this philosophy, you will claim to never have had a preference between life and death,” Cāṇakya had observed. “Yet on each of these days, you and all the other adherents of your school chose life over death. I do not know much of the peculiarities of the Magadhas, but in Gandhāra, if a housewife purchases groceries at the same shop each day, we say that she prefers that shop’s goods to those of others. If a king consistently purchases iron from the mines of the same country for his armoury, we say that he prefers that country’s mines to others. If a householder spends each night with one wife ignoring all others, we say that he prefers that wife to the rest.”<br>Cāṇakya had continued, before Śrībhānu could come up with a reply: “It seems there is little I need to convince you of, kid, for you already agree with me. You already have preferences, desires, ambitions – I do not need to convince you of their merit, only that you need no convincing.”<br>A mere concession from Śrībhānu would not have made this debate stand out in Cāṇakya’s memory – but after his concession, Śrībhānu had demonstrated his understanding of Cāṇakya’s argument by generalizing it thus:<br>“Indeed,” he had said, his eyes lit up in realization, “That is a contradiction, isn’t it? In my very argument against desire, I had relied on the assumption that suffering was undesirable. Do you say, then, that it is impossible to be devoid of desire?”<br>Cāṇakya, expressionless, had turned to the audience. “The focus on suffering is a fallacy of all Magadhi philosophers, not only of whom my opponent honoured, but also of the many schools of the Ājīvakas. It is childish to believe one can live without causing suffering at all, and if minimizing suffering, whether to others or to oneself, were the goal, then there are many methods to kill someone painlessly in their sleep. The very act of walking on the Earth causes pain to various insects and other beings that may dwell on its surface; yet it is righteous to do so, so long as the act leads to the creation of wealth. And thus I re-state my undefeated stance: that it is wealth and wealth alone that is important, and that suffering is only bad in so far as it harms one’s wealth, whether this wealth is in the form of one’s possessions, relations, knowledge or health.”<br>Thus Cāṇakya had won from the king, for Professor Caṇin, another herd of cows, each laden with heavy golden ornaments and various rare gems.<br>(Professor Caṇin would complain that he was running out of space to house the cows, to which Cāṇakya had replied: that is the great joy of wealth, Professor, that it can be traded to other forms. You may sell the cows for more gold, which is easier to store, or you may sell their ornaments for more space to house them.)<br>And for himself, he had won an immense excess of confidence in his own persuasive power – why, if he could in such short debate convince a boy of Magadhi noble lineage, who had spent his childhood living among barbarians and believing in barbarian philosophy, to abandon his deeply-held beliefs and adopt a diametrically opposite position, then, well, Cāṇakya ought to be deified as the god of debate.<br>And it was in this confidence that Cāṇakya had marched into the empire of darkness, to the dwelling of the very source of that darkness, on a mission to persuade the Emperor of Magadha to change his ways.<br>Professor Caṇin had warned him of the dangers of visiting a state like Magadha that was so different from them in their ways, and that his charm may be ineffectual or even dangerous there. He had finally given his blessing, satisfied after rehearsing with Cāṇakya several possible scenarios that may come to result in the court of Pāṭaliputra. But even Professor Caṇin had not foreseen this.<br>Now deep in the Dungeons of Ajātaśatru, Cāṇakya thought.<br>It was a dreadful feeling to await one’s death – whether announced by a king, a physician or a prophet. Suppressing panic, shock and all terrible emotions, Cāṇakya thought.<br>The prison system of Pāṭaliputra was impenetrable: from the outside and the inside, to men and to messages, by routes and tunnels or by physical force. It had been designed by Ajātaśatru a century and a half ago, and had all stood the test for as long.<br>What hasn’t stood the test? Cāṇakya thought. What – unlike the immortal bricks and stones and metals that comprised the prison – were no longer the same as they were in Ajātaśatru’s time?<br>(Somewhere in the back of his mind, Cāṇakya was shocked at how clearly he was able to think in this state: not once was he enticed by the thought of giving up and accepting his death like Śrībhānu would have implied, not once did he find that option appealing. Such was the nature of man: some primal instinct would kick in when one’s life was at stake, ridding the mind of foolish distractions, of romantic idealisms and of all squeamishness. A man possessed of sufficient intellect would in some way, with cold and calculating demeanour, loving nothing but his own life, caring for nothing the survival of his self, claw himself out of such a situation.)<br>“Am I the first child you’ve seen submitted for execution?” he asked the guards.<br>The strength of a door could be tested by physical methods; the method to interact with a man’s mind was to speak with him.<br>“The first?” one of them snorted, “Not even close.”<br>“Usually they’re crying for their mothers,” said another one. “You’re the first to accept your own death so calmly.”<br>Look sad. “I’m not one to accept my death so neutrally,” Cāṇakya said with a tender smile. “I love my life; it is dearer to me than anything else on Earth.”<br>The guards seemed unmoved by this. He noticed their tones in speech were all carefully neutral; expressing neither sympathy nor sadistic pleasure – as if they simply didn’t care. Cāṇakya needed to make a play that achieved three goals: (1) show the guards something unique, something that broke them out of their rut, so they didn’t view his execution as merely their job (2) cause the guards to befriend him and feel an immense responsibility to help him and (3) allowed him to understand the guards’ security flaws, both psychological and systemic.<br>And Cāṇakya knew the perfect play.<br>“You know what is second dearest to me, after my life?” he asked to no one in particular.<br>“Your mother?” suggested one of the guards – Cāṇakya quickly studied his eyes and decided that the guard intended that question as an insult, rather than an expression of sympathy.<br>“She died three years ago, and I lacked the wealth to so much as attend her funeral. And not my father either, for I never knew him.” Cāṇakya shook his sadly. “No, what I treasure most is—”<br>“Knowledge!” exclaimed another guard – at the weird looks he got from the other guards, he quickly explained: “I’ve … heard people care about that sort of thing … Brāhmaṇas … in the conquered Western realms.”<br>Cāṇakya quickly noted this guard’s face for future use, then nodded, putting on a most meaningful expression. “To discover things, to learn things, to teach things … it is the noblest pursuit. That is all I wish for.”<br>Some people believed that the art to manipulation was in lying.<br>Those people were wrong. The art to convincingly make people believe lies was to tell truths, things that you truly believed in, but by carefully picking which truths to speak, or by stringing those truths in a manner that apparently, but not truly, implied the lies you wished them to believe. This is because a true belief could be expressed with a conviction that a lie could not easily be, even if for dishonest purpose.<br>Finally, the guard who had guessed correctly spoke up. “In this prison, even an inmate’s wish for a last meal isn’t satisfied. None of us can teach you anything, nor do we have the intellect to learn what you can teach us.”<br>“There’s a game we play in Takṣaśilā,” said Cāṇakya, “It’s called Rājamaṇḍala, and we use it to teach students about many features of covert war, political alliance-making and the administration of justice. I believe that you could play it too. But the game requires six players; all five of you will need to play.”<br>(In fact, Cāṇakya had developed his own version of the game that also taught economics: in this version, no players had any loyalties, the emperor had to purchase information from them. But this version was far too complicated, and served no additional purpose, to play with the guards.)<br>It took some convincing from the nice guard; perhaps it was out of intrigue, or boredom, or genuine sympathy for boy’s plight, but all four remaining guards eventually acquiesced.<br><br>with_guards<br><br>PREFIX<br><br>TRANSCRIPT.<br>INITIAL NOTES.<br>It would hardly have been useful to demonstrate my own manipulation and cunning to the guards, thus I appointed myself emperor each game, claiming to the guards that it was by chance. It was my hope that this would cause them to superstitiously believe that I was some sort of chosen hero.<br><br>Game 1. Emperor: Cāṇakya.<br>Round 1.<br>
Victim: Rājastambha.
Alibis: Suhavis for Sulabhin. Sulabhin for Suhavis.
Inferences: One of Sarpamālin, Śaśaloman is a spy OR Suhavis, Sulabhin are both spies.
Behavioural observations: Sulabhin’s surprise at Suhavis giving him an alibi seemed genuine. Unlikely for them to both be spies.
Emperor shows mercy. 
<br>Round 2.<br>
Victim: Sarpamālin.
Alibis: Śaśaloman for Suhavis. Suhavis for Sulabhin.
Inferences: Śaśaloman is a spy OR Suhavis and Sulabhin are both spies.
Behavioural observations: None.
Emperor executes Śaśaloman.

Proclamation of his association with gods is as follows: holding conversation with, and worshipping, the spies who pretend to be the gods of fire or altar when through a tunnel they come to stand in the midst of fire, altar, or in the interior of a hollow image; holding conversation with, and worshipping, the spies who rise up from water and pretend to be the Nāga gods and goddesses; placing under water at night a mass of sea-foam mixed with burning oil, and exhibiting it as the spontaneous outbreak of fire, when it is burning in a line; sitting on a raft in water, which is secretly fastened by a rope to a rock; such magical performance in water as is usually done at night by bands of magicians, using the sack of abdomen or womb of water animals to hide the head and the nose, and applying to the nose the oil, prepared from the entrails of red spotted deer and the serum of the flesh of the crab, crocodile, porpoise and otter; holding conversation, as though with women of Varuna or of Nāga when they are performing magical tricks in water; and sending out volumes of smoke from the mouth on occasions of anger.

<br>Night had fallen.<br>As Sarpamālin’s shift ended, the boy offered him a piece of fabric taken from his dhoti to rest his head on. Half-asleep and barely attentive, Rājastambha noticed that all the previous guards were also asleep on similar pieces of cloth.<br>What a kind soul.<br>The guards of Ajātaśatru’s dungeons had been trained to be completely stoic in their emotion, to not betray the slightest sympathy for their prisoners – and to revile any of their members who did. Yet Rājastambha could not prevent himself from feeling sympathy for the boy’s plight. From what he had gathered, the boy had not harmed anyone, he had merely offered his advice to the emperor, and had politely acquiesced to leave when it was refused. And for that crime, he was to be executed.<br>“Rājastambha.”<br>Rājastambha was jolted out of his thoughts.<br>The boy Cāṇakya had prostrated himself before him, and was begging for his life most emotionally. Begging him to help him escape from prison.<br>Panicked at the thought of the other guards waking, he softly hissed: “Quiet!”<br>Cāṇakya seemed to read his thoughts. His voice jittery, he said: “I have put all the other guards to sleep. Please, grant me the boon of life.”<br>From any typical prisoner, Rājastambha would have remained unmoved – wouldn’t even have considered such a request.<br>But this was a request from a friend.<br>A friend who had taught him, and friend whom he knew, a friend who had told him profound truths about his own character from merely a short period of playing games.<br>(And somehow, already having been convinced to socialize with a prisoner in violation of the rules, and already feeling implicated, without cause, in the crime of intoxicating his colleagues, it became acceptable to consider such a proposal.)<br>The boy had chosen him, left him alone un-drugged, he had not offered him any material bribes, instead believing in the goodness in his character. To reject such a proposal felt like a betrayal of this trust, an acknowledgement of the corruption of his own soul.<br>But then he recalled what the consequences would be of such treason, and said so in so many words.<br>Cāṇakya looked at him square in the eyes and said:<br>“What did you learn from our game, Rājastambha? The source of the emperor’s information is in alibis – the art of successful deception lies in false alibis. This is not your shift; it is Sulabhin’s, thus there will not be any evidence of your responsibility in freeing me.”<br>The thought of framing his compatriot and having him executed for a crime of his own filled Rājastambha with disgust and horror, but Cāṇakya quickly added:<br>“You may have also observed, Rājastambha, how easy it is to tell a man’s innocence from his voice and tells; thus Sulabhin will not be believed to be guilty either; the purpose of framing someone is to secure your own alibi, not truly to incriminate them.”<br>Before Rājastambha could argue further, Cāṇakya fell back onto his knees, folding his hands and begging for freedom.<br>“I don’t want to die,” he cried, “Not at the age of eleven. I love my life.”<br>Despising himself more than he despised anyone else, Rājastambha forced himself to shake his head.<br>The sole torch in the cell blew out.<br>“ … ”<br>Rājastambha gulped audibly.<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>A sudden burst of light seared his eyeballs.<br>He slowly opened his eyes.<br>The boy who had just been whimpering and begging for his life now stood upright, the slightest hint of emotion having vanished from his face. His previously white dhoti had turned golden; his left arm was folded with his palm facing to his right, and the other hand was outstretched in blessing. A silver halo emanated from the back of his head.<br>A peacock feather decorated his untied hair.<br>Rājastambha’s mind filled in the sound of conch shells being blown.<br>I do not mind the fool who knows little, Cāṇakya had said after their games. But a fool who fails to recognize the truth even when it is told to his face in simple terms, even upon seeing it in all its obvious glory, even refuses it – that is the mark of a barbarian.<br>The day that Mathura had been razed, Rājastambha had asked the priest of the Saṃkarṣaṇa temple the natural question: We are told that brighter days will come, that the Heir of Saṃkarṣaṇa will return. How will we know to recognize him, when he does?<br>The priest had pridefully twirled his moustache and asked: How does one recognize the Sun when it rises at dawn?<br>Had Magadha truly changed him – had he truly turned himself into a barbarian?<br>Was he now no different from the men who had once slaughtered his countrymen?<br>Had he forgotten to recognize the Sun?<br>Lord Vāsudeva stood before him in all his glory, and yet Rājastambha had not recognized him.<br>“Forgive me, lord!” he cried, falling to his knees.<br>

Pabbata was honestly impressed by his own guile.<br>His father had almost immediately caught on to the fact that Pabbata intended to use Cāṇakya in his own war against his brothers when the day came. Pabbata didn’t care; his father was too lazy and unmotivated to bother stopping him, and didn’t quite care who inherited the throne after him. Balding and burping, his repulsive father was hardly a threat to him.<br>“I assure you, father,” he had said, “That I am loyal to you and to my brothers. I intend to use Cāṇakya not against Magadha, but in her service.”<br>If Pabbata had judged Cāṇakya’s character correctly, the indignant, idealistic boy would almost certainly, upon being freed, declare himself an enemy of Magadha. Already being remarkably popular in Takṣaśilā for his intellect, his activities would undoubtedly catch the attention of other enemies of Magadha who may consult with him or employ him as a figurehead. By being close to Cāṇakya, Pabbata could spy on these enemies far more efficiently than any of the government spies ever could – as well as influence them through Cāṇakya, thus emerging victorious both ways.<br>Pabbata congratulated himself. He was really starting to believe his own lies.<br>Dhanānanda had laughed, asking what use could that Brāhmaṇa boy possibly be to his prince.<br>“He is very naïve on matters of understanding people,” Pabbata had agreed. “There is no doubt on that. Yet I have spoken to him earlier, and he is of considerable intellect. In fact his naivety is an advantage to us, for it makes him easily exploitable.”<br>Grinning, Pabbata had told his father his plan.<br>He would approach Cāṇakya asking for his support against a fratricidal war against his brothers – just what his father thought was what he wanted; Cāṇakya, despite not being in any position to reject his offer, would likely place some kind of condition in exchange for his support, like requiring that Pabbata accept him as his teacher so he could undo his Magadhi upbringing.<br>At this point Dhanānanda had interjected, pointing out that Pabbata would be a fool to accept that deal.<br>Pabbata had shaken his head.<br>“But what he doesn’t realize, and neither do you, father, is that this is no price – it is precisely that education that I desire from him. I have no ambitions for the throne of Magadha, I truly do not, that rightfully belongs to my brother. I wish to learn his knowledge and use it against him, against the enemies of Magadha, in service of my brothers. That is the plain truth, father.”<br>Of course, that was hardly the complete truth: Pabbata absolutely desired the throne of Magadha for himself. Well, every man desired the throne of Magadha for himself, although over the last several generations, the throne of Magadha had proved itself to be the clan whore.<br>After having received advice from Pabbata that later proved true, and after being rescued by him twice from the mouth of death, Cāṇakya was sure to trust him completely.<br>So while Cāṇakya attempted to re-educate Pabbata in his own image, he would, before he knew it, find himself moulded into Pabbata’s loyal minister, guide the prince to his victory and then secure the possession acquired in that victory. And if after several years Cāṇakya proved to be too independent and impervious to such influence, then Pabbata would capture him and all his allies, and march back to Pāṭaliputra a hero, thus securing his victory in that way.<br>With either outcome, Pabbata’s victory was guaranteed.<br>With that happy thought, he descended into the dungeons to free Cāṇakya.<br>trees<br><br><br>

<br>That night, Cāṇakya was re-born.<br>All his idealism, all his irrational faith in men’s desire for the truth, indeed all his adorable childlike naivety left him that night.<br>Cāṇakya had not manipulated a wicked man.<br>Cāṇakya had manipulated a kind and conscientious man, whose insecurities he had learned on the pretence of befriending him. He had previously sown various powders into a fragment of his dhoti, and under the excuse of offering cushions to the guards, tore off the fragment and held it over his torch, rendering them unconscious with its smoke. He had previously planted the seed in Rājastambha’s mind of the memory of Vāsudeva, exploiting his insecurities so that even a cheap spectacle with some lighting and a peacock feather was sufficient to guilt him into servitude.<br>He had given Rājastambha an alibi, not to protect him, but in order to give him false hope. In truth, Dhanānanda would almost certainly execute all five guards when Cāṇakya was found missing in his cell the next morning. Such little value had Cāṇakya assigned to the guard’s life, that he had subsequently employed him as his spy in Pāṭaliputra, dooming him to his eventual death even if he were somehow miraculously spared the next day.<br>Cāṇakya felt no guilt. Such guilt served no purpose.<br>It was easy to congratulate himself on his successful escape, but the truth was that it was not his ingenuity that had served him, but pure luck. Had he not happened to meet Pabbata in the courtroom, had Pabbata not intervened on his behalf, had Dhanānanda not heard his son and agreed to delay the execution, had the guards refused point-blank from socializing with him … had any one of those occurrences gone wrong, Cāṇakya would have been dead.<br>Cāṇakya had been a fool to simply march into the empire of darkness, into its capital city and directly into the dwelling of the very source of that darkness that was its king.<br>A throne so powerful, yet so unstable as to pass from king to king each decade through executions, was hardly a throne that could be trusted. All of Professor Caṇin’s preparations had been based on his knowledge of the previous king Mahāpadma; he had had no idea of the extent of Dhanānanda’s barbarism.<br>He had been a fool to not bother learning about a barbarian king from his people before speaking to him.<br>He had been a fool to not make a detailed escape plan in advance, to not strategize in advance, were the situation to go awry.<br>He had been a fool to neglect Pabbata’s advice without considering that it may have been based even partially in truth.<br>He had been a fool to not question Pabbata or anyone else further on what the consequences of such an interaction might be; had he done so, he may have learned of Dhanānanda’s casual homicidal proclivities a bit earlier and have had the time to escape.<br>He had been a fool to not leave the city upon receiving news of how the king had treated the attendant who had requested his audience.<br>He had been a fool to not realize what he’d gotten himself into even after the emperor had mentioned his execution of the wrestlers and dancers.<br>Now as he walked along the Northern Highway that moonless night, disguised as an Ājīvaka monk, Cāṇakya thought, for the first time, about human nature.<br>(Most prison escapees preferred to wear more clothes, not less, to conceal themselves. Cāṇakya, too, had no desire to roam an unfamiliar country naked in the winter – however, disguising himself as a merchant would have required him to carry merchandise, and a Brāhmaṇa scholar in the Nanda capital would be seen as so odd that to assume that identity would certainly expose him. Pāṭaliputra had no secret tunnels, either; the engineering feat of building tunnels out of a water fort was restricted to the Vedic cities to its West – this raised some security questions about surrounding cities.)<br>Not in the abstract sense that he had discussed in the Arthaśāstra. It was economics, the science of his own development, that contained the laws that governed the behaviour of men. He had described the manner in which men pursued their goals, and the manner in which they ought to.<br>But he had never put any critical thought into questioning his conception of what these goals actually were.<br>Executing a scholar who came to his court offering cheap information was stupid.<br>Even if Dhanānanda had truly believed Cāṇakya’s advice to be incorrect, adopting such a policy would only discourage his subjects from attempting to advise him, or even interacting him in any way, depriving him of critical information and support. Did that, then, contradict Cāṇakya’s theories?<br>No. His theories were based in pure reason. But in his natural childish idealism, Cāṇakya had assumed that all men desired to know the truth, that all men cared about what they professed to care about, that all men cared at least for their own personal wealth.<br>Dhanānanda didn’t enjoy wealth.<br>He enjoyed looking decisive and powerful.<br>Yet a single interjection from Pabbata had been sufficient to get the emperor to retract his order.<br>Because Dhanānanda enjoyed looking statesmanly.<br>Cāṇakya tried to imagine what the emperor’s reaction would have been if someone else had interjected, saying, “No, actually just kill this kid, he’s kind of annoying.” His mind generated an image of Dhanānanda sneering: “Why do you bother me with quibbles on such minor logistic details? The Brāhmaṇa boy’s execution is scheduled for tomorrow at noon. Any objectors will be executed alongside him.”<br>Because Dhanānanda enjoyed looking high-status.<br>The greater number of common people – including kings and such – didn’t truly value what they claimed to value.<br>A king who said he cared about his people would bankrupt the royal treasury on wasteful government programs that benefit no one and end up raising taxes to unbearable levels. Because such a king did not truly care about his people – he cared about appearing to care about his people.<br>A king who said he cared about his personal wealth would lavishly display his wealth and ornaments leading to financial mismanagement and his eventual bankruptcy. Because such a king did not truly care about being wealthy – he cared about appearing wealthy.<br>A king who claimed to be a scholarly king who cared about the truth would often a time choose philosophers of particularly stupid ideologies as his advisors. Because such a king did not truly care about the truth – he cared about appearing to care about the truth.<br>And such was the nature of pretentious society, that people invested themselves into confirming these self-descriptions of their friends. A man who claimed himself to be intelligent, or who spoke with such lexicon and walked with such gait as to signal thus, would have his intellect spoken highly of in such a society, and none would so much as tease him for actions that betrayed his stupidity.<br>Thus the argument for why a king ought to befriend only sharp-tongued Brāhmaṇa ministers who were possessed of a tradition of frank honesty, and who had never heard of such a thing as flattery.<br>What Cāṇakya had witnessed that day was a clash of cultures in its truest sense: between the scholarship of the enlightened Vedic culture and the mindless mutual self-indulgences of the barbaric Magadhas. The cause for such a clash was man’s proclivity to assume that everyone who looked sufficiently similar to him must also think sufficiently similarly to him.<br>That was Cāṇakya’s answer to Professor Caṇin’s claim many years ago that the notions of “civilized” and “barbarian” were artificial constructs invented for some political purpose. Their true purpose was to remind men to be cautious among barbarians, to study their customs in detail without assuming any of those customs to be similar to one’s own.<br>Why Magadha? There were non-Vedic cultures in which even mere words and symbols were considered blasphemous, and where every member of these cultures defended so vigorously these obviously irrational social norms. It was essential that such a culture be described as barbarian so that travellers could better protect their selves.<br>By erring on something which would have been so obvious to any traveller, Cāṇakya had proved himself still seriously lacking in sense.<br>I have to raise my intelligence.<br>I have to learn the art of cunning.<br>Cāṇakya thought back to his last conversation with Rājastambha.<br>“I wish I could say that I helped you to save myself from committing the sin of Brahmahatya,” Rājastambha had said, “But in truth, I have been complicit to that crime so many times in the past that I could not possibly make up for it with one good deed.”<br>“The concept of atoning for one’s sins is the fallacy of Magadhi philosophy,” Cāṇakya had replied, “The goal of life is not to merely ensure that one does more good than bad, it is not to merely justify your existence in the world. The goal of life is to do as much good as possible, and that rarely comes from men who justify their actions on basis of doing good. Therein lies the distinction, between goodness and greatness.”<br>(From there he had claimed that Rājastambha could do the most good by serving him in Pāṭaliputra as his spy, carrying out and reporting small tasks for Cāṇakya.)<br>But despite the truth of these words, however, Cāṇakya found himself pronouncing a very particular oath, motivated by the cause that Rājastambha’s impending death not be in vain.<br>He did not intend to publicize this oath to anyone, not even to Professor Caṇin, not even by means of any visual indicators, for secrecy until cause arrived to be public was the way of wisdom.<br>Taking one single short break from that brisk pace that had judged to be optimal, Cāṇakya turned his head, laying his fiery eyes on the walls of Pāṭaliputra one last time before they faded out of view.<br>For that night, Cāṇakya gained a true understanding of his own ambition, and made an honest acknowledgement of the means that were required of him to achieve that ambition.<br>So many great minds had worked for the goal of preserving Vedic culture from the Magadhas – to protect their one little corner, the city of Mathura, from Magadhi conquest. And they had failed.<br>I swear to uproot you, Dhanānanda – to defeat your entire empire and the culture it manifests.<br>By restricting their ambitions so – to only defense of their realm, to never consider an offensive strike against the source of their problems itself – they had resigned their lives only fighting to protect the little corner they found themselves in.<br>Speaking to the fertile lands of Magadha, to the rivers that irrigated it, to its human settlements, Cāṇakya spoke.<br>I claim you as mine, he said – in the epic historical battle between the light of the Vedas and the wickedness that originated in this realm, the final move shall be mine.<br>And simply defending one’s holdings, or re-taking lost territories, would hardly be such a final move.<br>I will return, wielding in battle that torch that Vasiṣṭha had borne so many years ago taking the Bhāratas to their victory against the Purus – I shall take that throne you forbade me from resting on, and give it in charity to the deserving.<br>I swear to adopt the art of cunning; to be restrained by no foolish idealisms; to employ any means necessary to accomplish these goals.<br>Let it be known for centuries forth: that Magadha, after conquering Mathura, found herself conquered by her.]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/1/1.5.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/1/1.5.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 14:24:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[1.6]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>Pabbata’s grip tightened on the hilt of his sword, and his face had turned pale in horror.<br>All five guards had prostrated themselves before him, claiming their innocence and begging for his forgiveness.<br>“Whose mercy do you wish for?” the prince asked through gritted teeth. “Mine, or my father’s?”<br>The guards continued to wail incoherently. He kicked one who had grabbed his ankle.<br>Not only was this threatening to ruin all of Pabbata’s plans, this would seriously damage his image in his father’s eyes, even if Pabbata had had nothing to do with Cāṇakya’s escape nor the security of his imprisonment, because the emperor now viewed Cāṇakya and all the problems surrounding him as among Pabbata’s affairs.<br>“Listen here,” he pronounced, “You wish for my mercy? You will have it. I will tell father that it was on my orders that you released Cāṇakya from his cell. And this is what you will tell everyone as well – your friends, your family, everyone. I shall not reveal to any of them the truth of your incompetence.”<br>“We are grateful, O kind prince, we are gra—”<br>“But I have two conditions,” Pabbata interjected with a fierce glare. “One, obviously, the five of you shall be my slaves in this life and the next six, heeding every word of mine.

High birth, godliness, heroism, seeing through the eyes of elders, virtue, truthfulness, non-contradiction, gratefulness, high goals, enthusiasm, non-procrastination, power, resolute mind, an assembly of viceless ministers, a taste for discipline; these are the qualities of an inviting nature.
Inquiry, hearing, perception, retention in memory, reflection, deliberation, inference and steadfast adherence to conclusions are the qualities of the intellect.
Valour, determination of purpose, quickness, and probity are the aspects of enthusiasm.
Sharp intellect, strong memory, keen mind, energy, power, training in all the arts, vicelessness, justice, dignity, preparedness, foresight, readiness to avail himself of afforded opportunities in respect of place, time, and manly efforts, cleverness to discern the cause for peace treaty or war, capacity to make jokes without loss of dignity or secrecy, never brow-beating and casting haughty and stern looks, freedom from passion, anger, greed, obstinacy, fickleness, haste and back-biting habits, a smiling demeanour, observance of elders’ customs; such is the nature of self-possession.

<br>Cāṇakya wasn’t too worried about getting caught.<br>The fastest route out of Pāṭaliputra was the Northern Highway, so he would be alerted in advance of any search party sent in pursuit of him, and he simply had to hide in the bushes while it passed. He considered that a kingdom ought to have a better alert system, such as a sequence of lighthouses to be lit in succession along the highway, or simply conch-blowers placed at regular intervals.<br>What Cāṇakya was more concerned about was him voluntarily submitting to capture.<br>Although he had broken out of prison on his own accord anyway, he was fairly certain that Pabbata had been making some sort of effort to have him pardoned, for whatever purpose that he sought Cāṇakya for. Based on the interaction that Cāṇakya had observed earlier between Dhanānanda and his son, Cāṇakya estimated a high chance of this attempt succeeding.<br>The question then arose, of how the search party would approach precisely.<br>There were several possibilities.<br>One, a standard search party may approach, should Dhanānanda’s men be the first to discover Cāṇakya missing, or should Pabbata tell his father about Cāṇakya’s escape and Dhanānanda be responsive to this information in this way. In this case, Cāṇakya merely had to hide, then bother about contacting Pabbata after safely making it to Takṣaśilā.<br>Two, if Pabbata initiated the search himself, he might do so under his own name, clearly announcing his intent at various cities on the highway. In this case, Cāṇakya would need to stalk him until he could isolate Pabbata and confront him himself, having prepared a decent escape plan.<br>Three, Pabbata may initiate the search under one of his brothers’ names, as a search for both Pabbata and Cāṇakya who had escaped – this way, the emperor wouldn’t learn of Cāṇakya’s escape and simply assume there was some disagreement between brothers. In this case, Cāṇakya would need to first find Pabbata himself, then stalk and isolate him, having prepared a decent escape plan.<br>Four, Pabbata may initiate the search under some entirely different pretense, such as a search for child slaves, or a survey of recent migrants to each city – or even, having gathered the information from those who guarded the gates of Pāṭaliputra, a registration of Ājīvaka monks. Thus Cāṇakya had to avoid entering walled cities, instead monitoring the happenings from the outside.<br>(And Cāṇakya acknowledged, in some corner of his mind, that this was how he had to think – to consider every possibility that may arise, and decide on the optimal course of action in response, and to consider every possible hurdle in that course of action, the response to that, and thus so.)<br>scheme_0<br><br><br>
If a chief among the neighbouring kings seems to give trouble, the minister may invite him, saying "come here and I shall make thee king," and then put him to death.

<br>After making precautions to meet in a forested tract where Pabbata’s cavalry companions couldn’t easily pursue him, and having made plans for escape (such a severed log that he could push into a pond to feign that he had jumped into it, should he be pursued), and having found an opportune moment where Pabbata was isolated from his army – as an archer isolated his target from a phalanx to shoot him, or as a man isolated a courtesan from her ill-mannered companions to court her – Cāṇakya showed himself to Pabbata.<br>“Cāṇakya!” Pabbata cried, then cringed. “And do you have to maintain that appearance?”<br>Cāṇakya accepted the dhoti. “I assume that if you sought to return me to my prison, you would have hardly gone to the trouble of all this pretense to capture me. I will answer to your demands, but you must first dismiss your army.”<br>The Magadhi prince made a questioning gesture. “You believe that if you could escape my friends if I ordered them to capture you?”<br>“I broke out of Pāṭaliputra’s highest-security dungeons, designed by Ajātaśatru himself. Do you truly believe that I couldn’t escape three kids the same age as myself?”<br>Pabbata nodded, then turned to his minion. “Devajit,” he said. “Do as he says. I will be away from Magadha for an extended period of time as previously discussed; in that time, you shall be my messenger and representative in Pāṭaliputra.”<br>Then he turned to his other, younger minion: “You will accompany me, Candragupta.”]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/1/1.6.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/1/1.6.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 14:20:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[1.7]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>“Well?”<br>Pabbata smirked internally, proud at the cleverness of his dealings. By telling has father openly that he would ask for Cāṇakya’s support in a fratricidal war, he was able to frankly deal with Cāṇakya while maintaining plausible deniability for any report that might reach his father.<br>Ha, fool! You may have fooled your father – well, even your mother probably fooled your father – but you cannot fool me – I am fully familiar with the art of double-crossing. You have previously spoken to your father on this proposition that you will bring to me, giving some sort of excuse, such as “I will portray myself as an enemy of Magadha, and spy for you and for my brothers” while privately leaving open to yourself both options of alliance and treachery.<br>That is what Cāṇakya would have said, if instead of truly desirous to exercise cunning, Cāṇakya had only cared to appear cunning, as ordinary people did. But it was far more advantageous to continue to appear naïve, to make Pabbata complacent, and to respond in a manner that was consistent with his expectations.<br>He placed his foot on a protruding boulder, and spoke slowly.<br>“I have always said, Pabbata, that a fool is not one who does not know the truth; a fool is one who fails to recognize the truth even after it is shown to him most explicitly in its most glorious form. By recognizing my capacities as Dhanānanda did not, you have proven yourself to be in possession of the quality that I seek in my dearest friends. Thus, I shall agree to associate with you.”<br>Pabbata smiled, but seemed expectant.<br>You desire not only my intellect as an ally, but also my instruction in the sciences, seeking to use only that instruction that will grant your political victory and subsequent security while neglecting my moral instruction. You have not expressed this desire in these words, so as to deceive me into believing I have imposed a condition on you, when I demand it from you for my own purposes. Well, let me accept this unspoken request – for there is no means by which you could defeat me in the game we are about to play.<br>“But you have had a Magadhi upbringing, and this cannot be neglected,” Cāṇakya continued, carefully observing the prince’s reaction and smiling internally at his observations. “Thus, I will require that you enroll at the University of Takṣaśilā – there, over the course of the next several years leading up to the war you intend to wage, I will teach you the sciences and the Vedas, and we shall form a detailed plan to plot your rise to power.”<br>Cāṇakya was aware that playing the game against Pabbata would be risky.<br>The dignified persona that Pabbata wore in Cāṇakya’s presence was not representative of his true character – that much was certain. Cāṇakya was sure that when the time came, Pabbata wouldn’t hesitate to capture him and take him to Pāṭaliputra if he decided treachery to be more profitable than alliance at that time.<br>There was also the distinct possibility that Dhanānanda’s irrational anger and sentencing was itself a conspiracy by Pabbata to manipulate Cāṇakya to join his side. No honourable standards could be expected of a man who had a barbarian upbringing, no depth could be assumed lower than which he wouldn’t stoop – and conversely, no such standards ought to be respected by civilized men in a fight against barbarians, for to abide by rules that your opponents didn’t was equal to accepting defeat.<br>But Cāṇakya would hardly reject Pabbata’s offer – there was much benefit to be had in securing a powerful ally, even an unreliable one, and Cāṇakya had to first enter the game that he wished to play.<br>“I accept your conditions,” said Pabbata.<br>And thus the game had begun.<br>education<br><br><br>

<br>It took them half a fortnight to reach the country of the Pañcālas, which lied on the Western-most border of Magadha’s imperial extent.<br>Half the journey still remained.<br>Having had spent some time with both Pabbata and Candragupta, Cāṇakya had obtained a sense of both their personalities, and had observed a considerable intellect and curiosity in Candragupta that he had not expected in a minion whose life had been sworn to loyalty. It was a far stretch, and by no means a certainty, but it was worth exploring multiple plans in case one didn’t come to fruition as expected.<br>Of course, Cāṇakya could hardly be seen dealing directly with Candragupta, nor could he risk Candragupta reporting such a conversation directly to Pabbata.<br>Thus the adoption of the posture of a double-crosser: the art of betraying a friend in plain sight.<br>Cāṇakya drank the last drop of water from his vessel, claiming to be parched. When Candragupta had left to find water, Cāṇakya spoke to Pabbata.<br>“There are many reasons why a typical prince prefers to have multiple allies flanking them at university, one such reason being that it is harder for a group to maintain a conspiracy than for a single person. Are you so sure of Candragupta’s loyalty to you?”<br>Pabbata smirked. “I assure you, Cāṇakya, that there is no tactic known to man that could sway Candragupta on the quality of loyalty.”<br>“I will bet you one paṇa that I could.”<br>“Oh?” Pabbata raised an eyebrow. “Well, Cāṇakya, if you are successful in eliciting from Candragupta’s mouth a single sentence about me that is anything short of unqualified praise, I shall give you a hundred paṇas.” Then he added: “In addition, of course, to Candragupta’s severed head.”<br>def_victory<br><br><br>
When the profit accruing to kings under an agreement, whether they be of equal, inferior, or superior power, is equal to all, that agreement is termed peace; when unequal, it is termed defeat. Such is the nature of peace and war.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 7.8:34
<br>After Pabbata excused himself with some effortlessly produced excuse, Cāṇakya spoke to Candragupta. As the standard initiation of conversation, he asked:<br>“What caste and country are you of?”<br>Candragupta looked surprised. “I am of Ayodhya, and of Vaiṣya caste,” he said.<br>“Oh? How did you come to befriend Pabbata?”<br>“It was out of his kindness that the prince offered me his friendship when we met,” said Candragupta.<br>Cāṇakya paused for a moment to calculate the most acceptable way to prod further. “Does the prince leave Pāṭaliputra so often? That must be quite dangerous, especially with assassinations having become a children’s sport.”<br>“No,” Candragupta answered. “We met in Pāṭaliputra.”<br>Cāṇakya paused again to think. “Well, you must be quite thankful for that visit.”<br>Candragupta didn’t answer.<br>I see.<br>“I noticed you haven’t yet written or sent a message to your parents about your move to Takṣaśilā. Surely Pabbata would be willing to sponsor a messenger; what’s of them?”<br>Candragupta looked hesitant to answer again, but eventually admitted:<br>“They’re dead.”<br>That’s what Cāṇakya had guessed. And if the remainder of his guess was true as well …<br>He nodded sympathetically. “If you don’t mind me asking, how did your parents die?”<br>“They were executed.”<br>“ … by the vassal king of Kosala?”<br>Candragupta shook his head.<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>(Cāṇakya took this time to decide exactly how much time he ought to wait for before initiating the truly important conversation. When he judged that enough time had passed, he spoke.)<br>“Do not take this as any form of instigation, Candragupta,” he said, “Nor of ill-will against anyone. But if Dhanānanda killed your parents, why do you work for his son?”<br>Candragupta shot him an offended look, then spoke the longest sentence that Cāṇakya had heard from the kid’s mouth yet. “Is it equally immoral, then, for you to associate with Pabbata for his father’s sin of killing my parents? Or is it only I who ought to care about my parents, so that each man merely makes an enemy out of those whose associates have personally harmed him?”<br>“Indeed,” Cāṇakya agreed, “That would make it quite easy to be wicked, by simply committing wicked acts, then dividing them among a number of messengers.”<br>“Furthermore, I have no intention to avenge my parents’ deaths as such; and Pabbata is not responsible for my parents’ deaths. Pabbata offered me shelter and employment in a time of grief and chaos, and for this I shall always be thankful.”<br>“If it is his provision of shelter and employment to you that is the basis of your loyalty to him, would you switch your loyalties to someone who provides you with superior of the same, or who provides you with other forms of material wealth that you desire more?”<br>“It would be most senseless to confess to such an outlook,” said Candragupta, “And most disloyal to possess one.”<br>“And you possess this quality of loyalty?”<br>“I have always been loyal to my master as long as I have had one, and desire to maintain this habit for as long as I will have one.”<br>It was subtle, but every one of Candragupta’s words had been precisely what Cāṇakya had wished to hear. He had not spoken a word in foolish emotionality, whether against his master or in his defence, instead maintaining dignified restraint. He had shown himself to be motivated by goals higher than mere revenge, and to possess a notion of kinship that extended beyond his mere family and tribe.<br>Cāṇakya had not yet truly articulated, even mentally, that he was testing both Pabbata and Candragupta as prospective future emperors of Magadha. His ambitions – and relief to the troubles that ailed the country – did not strictly require preserving an imperial Magadha as such; there was the desire of many scholars at Takṣaśilā to return to the period of Mahājanapadas, to the state of affairs that had persisted before Ajātaśatru’s conquests.<br>Yet Cāṇakya noted subconsciously that Candragupta, in short conversation, had demonstrated numerous qualities that were desirable in a king, and none of such vices. He also noted that being of Ayodhya, Candragupta would likely be acceptable as a king to the people of Magadha, who viewed Ayodhya as being of their own country even if the people of Ayodhya did not return that view.<br>There was just one question to confirm or deny Cāṇakya’s impression of the boy.<br>“And do you believe Pabbata returns your loyalty? He and his family live in a magnificent palace – he does not see you as deserving of any such amenities; indeed, he sees you as one of these amenities yourself.”<br>“Would my life be substantially improved if Pabbata were deprived of these amenities? Regardless of the differences between my view of him and his of me, the truth remains that my life would be substantially worse if I were to disassociate from Pabbata on count of either envy or vengefulness.”<br>Indeed, thought Cāṇakya, It is a fallacy to expect any associate – whether an ally, a friend, or a lover – to provide you with precisely the same as what you provided them with. As usual, an economic perspective helps shed light on this: an “equal” relationship is akin to paying a grocer in precisely the same goods that you receive from him – this benefits neither you nor the seller, it is entirely fruitless, and merely a waste of time and effort. If you desire the same provision from your associate as you provide them, then you could as well provide it to yourself.<br>However, even if the precise provisions of each party differ, it is just for the total value, as measured in gold, of the gain to each party to be equal – when they are unequal, a friendship transcends into a game of victory and defeat. Thus, just as one desires to purchase goods at the lowest price possible and to sell goods at the highest, one must seek to increase the benefits that he receives from his friends.<br>This was the quality of “ambition”, which was perhaps the most essential quality in a king. Candragupta had not demonstrated this quality; yet if he was truly of Vaiṣya blood, the desire to acquire wealth had to be innate to him, and merely suppressed by his slavery to Pabbata.<br>Candragupta noticed Cāṇakya deep in thought, and raised his eyebrows.<br>“Well,” he asked, “What will you tell Pabbata?”<br>Cāṇakya smiled very widely.<br>negligence<br><br><br>
Negligence to rescue a person under the clutches of a tiger shall be punished with a fine of 12 paṇas. Similar sum of money shall be given as a reward to him who kills a tiger.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 4.3:30-32
<br>“I must applaud your sensibility in making and securing friends,” Cāṇakya said to Pabbata’s smirk. “I’ll pay up once we reach Takṣaśilā.”]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/1/1.7.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/1/1.7.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 14:24:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[1.8]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>which_is_better<br><br><br>
Which is better of the two, a small mine of valuable yield, or a big mine productive of commodities of inferior value? My teacher says that the former is better inasmuch as valuable products, such as diamonds, precious stones, pearls, corals, gold and silver, can swallow vast quantities of inferior commodities.
Not so, says Kautilya, for there is the possibility of purchasing valuable commodities by a mass of accumulated articles of inferior value, collected from a vast and longstanding mine of inferior commodities.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 7.12:14-16
<br>“I see – it appears that matters have deteriorated greatly from the time of Emperor Mahāpadma. I should have known better; you are young and inexperienced, Viṣṇugupta, but I should have made the effort to acquire more information before allowing you so freely to visit Pāṭaliputra.”<br>Cāṇakya felt somewhat offended. “I cannot blame you for it, Professor,” he said, “I must not consider myself entitled to rely on your wisdom for my protection much longer. If I wish to have an impact in politics, I must learn the art of cunning for myself.”<br>Professor Caṇin nodded with some amount of unspoken pride.<br>“I do have one thing to say, though,” Cāṇakya continued, “With no disrespect intended. I believe that your negligence, and mine, can be attributed at least in part to your lack of appreciation for the wisdom of the classification of tribes as civilized and barbarian.”<br>At Professor Caṇin’s questioning gesture, he explained: “There is a natural proclivity of man to assume that all others are like him. Thus to correct this bias, men need to be warned otherwise. That is the cause for the system of castes, and that is the cause for the classification of tribes as barbarians. Because while we may have wicked practices of our own, those practices are those that do not shock us, unlike the unknown evils that we lack the proclivity to correctly anticipate among a barbarian people.”<br>The quality that Cāṇakya was rather fond of in Professor Caṇin was his ever-willingness to hear honest criticism, as well as his readiness to change his mind upon hearing correct counter-arguments, even if he had previously stated his opinion in the firmest terms and not made this readiness apparent. It was very beneficial to have a friend of this nature, as you could truly value their considered opinions.<br>“There is wisdom to your words, Viṣṇugupta,” Professor Caṇin accepted at last. “A visit like yours could not possibly be imagined to have been dangerous in Gandhāra, not even to one’s wildest imagination. So even while I made precautions, I didn’t consider that Magadha could change so substantially from one king to the next. If I had, I could have prepared you better. In not doing so, I have failed in my duty as a teacher.”<br>They stayed silent for a while.<br>“On a more practical matter, Professor,” Cāṇakya said, “I have made two friends on my journey: Pabbata, the youngest prince of Magadha, and his informant Candragupta of Kosala. I would like to give them both an education befitting a kṣatriya.”<br>Professor Caṇin nodded slowly, to which Cāṇakya continued: “Would it be possible for you to accept them as your students, and allow me to teach them independently?”<br>“No, Viṣṇugupta,” he said, “Your war has begun, and you must fight it yourself.”<br>Cāṇakya straightened his back.<br>“I believe it is time for you to be afforded your own gurukula,” Professor Caṇin announced. “It is not traditional to graduate a student in four years instead of the traditional sixteen, but I believe that on account of your famed intellect and your achievements thus far, it should be possible to do so without significant opposition from any relevant parties.”<br>“I would be honoured, Professor,” said Cāṇakya, “But isn’t the ritual to graduate from studenthood marriage?”<br>The marriage of a child bride was forbidden in many ways and for many causes; and while Cāṇakya knew that he possessed sufficient intellect to completely ignore his “bride” and regard such a marriage as purely symbolic, that same sensibility could not be expected of the girl.<br>“Indeed. It would be neither possible nor legal for you to marry a girl of similar age to yourself, except perhaps with a Scythian or such barbarian girl, but there are even more moral objections to that. I believe there should not be much objection to a symbolic marriage of you to an animal or plant.”<br>Cāṇakya made a mental note that rituals were far less restrictive than they were often written to be, and to simply ask for what he wanted in future.<br>“I applaud your choice of allies to influence, Viṣṇugupta.” Caṇin’s eyes were distant. “I can only hope that you will choose with similar wisdom those who influence you.”<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>“Professor, do you believe that if I had planned better, and acted differently in Pāṭaliputra … ”<br>“No, I do not think there is any means by which you can effectively influence the politics of Magadha from within. No, I do not think there are any means but war against Magadha.”<br>“Perhaps we ought to spend some time and think about alternative approaches in more detail,” Cāṇakya suggested. “And if we find one, we could send another scholar, trained to that approach, with an apology for my behaviour—”<br>Professor Caṇin interrupted him with a wry yet sympathetic smile.<br>“Viṣṇugupta,” he said gently, “What good is a life of apology?”<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>Finally, Cāṇakya came to the question that was truly pressing in his mind. While he was aware that Caṇin shared his ambitions to some degree – from the conversation they’d had two years ago after the debacle with Vishtaspa – but they had not discussed the matter further since, and Cāṇakya was surprised to hear him mention it today.<br>“Professor,” he asked, “What did you mean when you said my war has begun?”<br>At Professor Caṇin’s silence, he continued.<br>“Many a time, you have said that I and I alone have the capacity to lead a revolution, to defeat Magadha and Persia, to restore the ways of the ancients and to improve upon them. Nothing could be more desirable to me, but I must know the answer to this question: when such sentiment is so widespread, then why, over the past one hundred and eighty years, has no Professor at Takṣaśilā successfully carried out such a revolution, against either Magadha or Persia? Why have you never sought such goals for your own achievement?”<br>Professor Caṇin answered after some delay. “There is honour in scholarly pursuit,” he said, “It is not necessary that every Brāhmaṇa here at Takṣaśilā must have political ambitions. Academic ambition is even more respectable.”<br>“Indeed, in the same way that the steel of the South is more respectable than the steel of Kosambi; nonetheless there is only so much steel that the South produces, and those who lack the wealth to purchase it must make do with the steel of Kosambi. Or how a wife of equal caste is more respectable than a wife of one caste lower; yet as men marry multiple women, a man must have wives of one caste lower. Or similarly of the horses of Kamboja against Eastern horses, or the elephants of Magadha against local ones. There is much profit to be made in such a revolution, and surely there must have been someone who rose to pick up this torch? What is it that causes you to believe that I am uniquely equipped to succeed in, in a manner that no one else has been?”<br>There was another pause.<br>“Do you know, Viṣṇugupta, why I so readily accepted you as my student all those years ago?”<br>“Because of my obvious intelligence?”<br>“That too.”<br>Before Cāṇakya could guess again, Caṇin continued: “In your brag, you mentioned the story of the Nāga ascetic who proclaimed, based on your teeth, that you were destined for kingship. You said that even after your father broke your teeth, the ascetic had said that if not king, you will be the power behind the throne. Do you understand what I am saying?”<br>Cāṇakya’s face must have shown his disappointment at that explanation, for Professor Caṇin continued: “Do not be silly – I do not care for what any ascetic has to say anything; in fact, I would much rather learn that you fabricated the entire story.”<br>After some brief deliberation, Cāṇakya answered: “You were impressed that I had chosen to include this story in my brag, not at the story itself. Forgive me, Professor, but I still do not see why.”<br>“Indeed you don’t – for what impressed me was that you saw no dishonour in the ascetic’s words. You neither considered the job of a king as something beneath your caste, nor were you then offended to be relegated to the power behind the throne.”<br>“You liked that what mattered to me was the actual consequences of my actions,” Cāṇakya completed, “Not social positions or titles, or the view that people might possess of me. That what matters to me is the actual accomplishment my goals, the realization of my ambitions, not my image or signalling of popular traits.”<br>Professor Caṇin nodded. “As you know, Viṣṇugupta: there are only three personality types of man: sattva (goodness), tamas (wicked) and rajas (greatness or ambitiousness) – and there is a certain invariance to these types. Even if you may have erred in these past fortnights, if you were deficient in your use of cunning, I believe that that judgement I made of your person four years ago remains true, that the qualities I believe you to possess – specifically, that of rajas – are innate to you.”<br>“It is,” Cāṇakya assured.<br>“Too many aged men emphasize sattva alone, but sattva without rajas is like an archer without his bow. Such a man, even as he goes to great lengths to do good rather than bad, never accomplishes any significant amount of good, for he is lacking in ambition. Certainly, the quality of sattva is to be honoured, as we honour cows – for the cow symbolizes sattva, as the vulture symbolizes tamas, yet neither of them is capable of ruling the world. No, it is man, and man alone, who possesses rajas, who is equipped to rule the world.<br>“Too many young men emphasize rajas alone: princes who spend their lives rallying armies to battle, never quite identifying what it is they are fighting for. Such men’s names are never immortalized in history, for in all their lives they accomplish nothing but the change of the colour of a flag on a fort, or some letters on a writ. For rajas alone, without sattva or tamas, is ambitiousness without ambition, it is passion without purpose. Such ones are mere tools to those men who possess true ambition.<br>“Sattva without rajas causes a small amount of good; tamas without rajas causes a small amount of evil; rajas alone causes a great amount of nonsense; a combination of sattva and rajas accomplishes a great amount of good; and a combination of sattva and tamas accomplishes a great deal of evil. Thus it is a combination of sattva and rajas that is necessary.<br>“Ajātaśatru, in his day, was a brilliant inventor and an ambitious conqueror,” Professor Caṇin continued. “Yet he was completely devoid of morality, and brought great ruin to the nations of the civilized world.”<br>“A combination of Tamas and Rajas,” Cāṇakya noted. “And on the other hand, all the rulers of the Mahājanapadas of the Central Country possessed Sattva but no Rajas, and thus they fell to Ajātaśatru.”<br>Professor Caṇin smiled. “All but one. The Consul of Mathura, the mighty Sage Saṃkarṣaṇa. He alone possessed both qualities of sattva and rajas, and he alone successfully resisted Ajātaśatru’s invasion. And to forelong his legacy, he sought to find a worthy successor who possessed in him these very qualities: who possessed as much rajas as Ajātaśatru did, and who possessed as much sattva as Ajātaśatru possessed tamas. And these were the qualities that Saṃkarṣaṇa found in Vāsudeva, whom he made his heir.”<br>“And these are the qualities you found in me,” Cāṇakya finished. “As the Heirs of Saṃkarṣaṇa resisted Magadhi conquest for one hundred and fifty years, you believe that I, possessed of these qualities, can invite a golden age of prosperity and Vedic scholarship.”<br>“Not quite, Viṣṇugupta,” said Professor Caṇin. “For these are the qualities you already possess, and they are the qualities that you must seek in your own Vāsudeva.”]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/1/1.8.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/1/1.8.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 14:20:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[1.9]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>elements<br><br>“THE ELEMENTS OF SOVEREIGNITY”<br>PREFIX<br><br>in: THE KAUTILYA LECTURES<br>Delivered initially in [date:-336|magadha] at Takṣaśilā, Gandhāra to the following students:<br>
<br>Apratimaujas a Brāhmaṇa of Gokula, Śūrasena
<br>Daṇḍaśarman a Brāhmaṇa of Ujjain, Avanti
<br>Pāṇini a Brāhmaṇa of Śalātura, Gandhāra
<br>Pabbata a kṣatriya of Pāṭaliputra, Magadha
<br>Candragupta a kṣatriya of Pāṭaliputra, Magadha
<br>Śrībhānu a kṣatriya of Kuṇḍagrāma, Vṛji
<br>Transcribed later from memory by Śrībhānu for the benefit of the Yavana girl Tara.<br>Edited and organized at the word of Professor Cāṇakya by the Yavana lady Tara.<br><br>Kaṇāda, the preceptor of the Vaiśeṣika (Reductionist) philosophy, says that the study of the Physical Sciences begins with the enumeration of the elements that comprise matter. He lists these elements as being of six types: substances, qualities, activities, generality, particularity and relationship. From this through the methods of perception and inference alone, all other laws of science can be explained.<br>Similarly, to discover the laws of the science of government, one must list the elements of sovereignty.<br>Uśanas says that the king is the sovereign. Bhāradvāja says that it is the minister. Viśālākṣa says that it is the country that is sovereign. Parāśara and Kauṇapadanta say that it is the army and the fort – my own preceptor is sympathetic to this stance. Pisuna says that it is the treasury – I too adopted this stance in my early days.<br>But none of these can be correct. In the game of chess, victory and loss depend entirely on the capture of the king; not so in real wars, for a king too can be sacrificed by a minister to win a war. The replacement or death of a minister is not as great a tragedy as the loss of a country to an enemy. The country alone cannot be sovereign, as we care about who rules it. And as for the army, the fort, the treasury – if any of these were the sole guarantor of sovereignty, the soldier who guarded the treasury doors would be truly powerful.<br>I will speak, more generally, of how order is established.<br>The guard of the treasury is loyal to the king because he thinks, “If I steal from the treasury, I will be punished when my theft is exposed by the auditor”, and furthermore, that if he attempts to conspire with the auditor, the auditor will think “The guard may be a spy for the king, this may be a ploy to test my honesty”.<br>If the guard and the auditor were of one mind, they could unite and conspire to steal the king’s wealth; if all the soldiers of a king were of one mind, they could unite and refuse to work for the king; if the vassals of an emperor were of one mind, they could unite and overthrow the emperor. But divided, they may be ruled.<br>I shall provide, for the purpose of understanding, other examples of such phenomena as they occur.<br>Prices are such a phenomena. Sellers, if they were capable of conspiring with each other, could set prices that were as high as they desired; however, if such a conspiracy were attempted, a seller would then think “the other seller may be a traitor, he may reduce his prices slightly one day and take all my clients for himself and increase his revenue manyfold”, and likewise the other seller. Or they may think “the other seller thinks as I do, and if I am capable of betrayal, so is he”. And so even the slightest rumour of dissension breaks the cartel that does not punish its traitors.<br>Language is such a phenomena. Scythians, if they could all will alike, could speak the Civilized Tongue and consequently speak and think with clarity as we do, and the effects of doing so would be beneficial to their economy. Yet each Scythian may think “If I alone start speaking Civilized Tongue, none of my colleagues would understand me”, and there is thus no cause for any one Scythian to speak the Civilized Tongue, even if there is reason for all Scythians together to do so.<br>And sovereignty is such a phenomena. Even when a conspiracy against the king is profitable – whether in the treasury, or in the army, or in the court, or by supporting enemy kings, each member must think “this conspiracy may be a ploy by the king to test me, and even if it is not, other members of it may choose to betray me for profit, thus I should betray it for profit first”.<br>Such is the nature of man: every decision is made by the will of one man, not by many together.<br>Thus it is a fallacy to make statements like “The rich do such things because it benefits them” or “The Brāhmaṇas do such things because it benefits them”. For while the behaviour of individuals may serve their interests, the behaviour of groups lacking in unity seldom does.<br>And thus the art of statecraft is the art of making alliances, so that it becomes profitable for each of its members to be loyal to the king, even if it would not have been profitable if they were lacking in unity.<br>Thus there are seven elements of sovereignty: the king, the minister, the country, the treasury, the army, the fort, and the ally, and the successful exercise of statecraft lies in binding these elements together through the latter element.<br>“Professor,” asks Apratimaujas, “Would this be a correct summary of your teaching? To exercise governance, it is necessary to have command over a large number of people, for if you have command only over a small number of people, they will have no cause to be loyal to you?”<br>“Continue under that assumption,” Cāṇakya directs.<br>“How, then, is an alliance ever defeated, or a new state ever established? It seems to me that in the absence of other allies being loyal, an ally has no cause to be loyal, and the same applies to each of those allies, and so on. It appears to be the same problem as that of teaching Scythians the Civilized Tongue.”<br>“I will say three things,” says Cāṇakya, “Firstly, kings may not have successfully instituted such a system as would instil loyalty, and such vulnerabilities may be exploited. Second, it is possible to ally with an existing powerful state against another powerful state, or to take loans, so it is not necessarily the case that you start with having no one as your ally. Third, there are methods to create loyalty among large numbers of people at once. But more generally, the question you’re raising is known as the problem of war.”<br><br>war<br><br>“THE CAUSES FOR WAR”<br>PREFIX<br><br>in: THE KAUTILYA LECTURES<br>Delivered initially in [date:-336|magadha] at Takṣaśilā, Gandhāra to the following students:<br>
<br>Apratimaujas a Brāhmaṇa of Gokula, Śūrasena
<br>Daṇḍaśarman a Brāhmaṇa of Ujjain, Avanti
<br>Pāṇini a Brāhmaṇa of Śalātura, Gandhāra
<br>Pabbata a kṣatriya of Pāṭaliputra, Magadha
<br>Candragupta a kṣatriya of Pāṭaliputra, Magadha
<br>Śrībhānu a kṣatriya of Kuṇḍagrāma, Vṛji
<br>Transcribed later from memory by Śrībhānu for the benefit of the Yavana girl Tara.<br>Edited and organized at the word of Professor Cāṇakya by the Yavana lady Tara.<br><br>“What is the objective of war?” asks Cāṇakya.<br>“To acquire more power,” Pabbata answers.<br>“And what such powers are acquired by war?” asks Cāṇakya.<br>“The power to tax,” suggests Pabbata.<br>“To improve the conquered country by enforcing security, eradicating wild tribes and such,” suggests Daṇḍaśarman.<br>“Or by creating academies and granting uncultivated lands to Brāhmaṇas for cultivation,” suggests Pāṇini.<br>“Or by improving the judicial system and outlawing wicked practices in the conquered country,” suggests Candragupta.<br>A conqueror may possess many goals, including taxation, enactment of better laws in the conquered land, protection or formation of trade networks, or control over locations of strategic importance such as to protect one’s country from invasion or to clear a path for one’s army to conquer the country beyond the conquered country. For all these goals, the conqueror requires the loyalties of men in the enemy’s country; thus in general terms the goal of the conqueror is to be able to govern the conquered country.<br>Sometimes this loyalty amounts to accepting the conquered king as a vassal, or in some cases even deposing him entirely, and governing the conquered country as a province of one’s own. But sometimes all that is desired is a trade treaty, or the protection of trade routes, or the installation of a ruler more friendly to the conqueror’s interests.<br>Much as one starts with the definition of the elements to explain the laws of science, one must start from the definition of war to explain the tactics of war. The term war invokes images of battles and expeditions, but the definition is far more general. For example, it also includes a coup or a civil war, or a war fought through deception alone.<br>The efforts taken to acquire some article in the sense of exercising right over it – a country, a route, a fort, port or strategic position, a water source, some loot, slaves, a woman or several, honour and glory – is termed war.<br>Some of these causes are just; others are not.<br>Those that impede such efforts are termed enemies.<br>“I have heard the term Cakravarti used to refer to an emperor who rules all of the civilized world,” says Candragupta, “Is that a just cause for war as well?”<br>Cāṇakya declines to answer that question.<br>I shall now discuss the means of waging war.<br>“Suppose that I wished to acquire the country of Avanti for the right to tax it,” says Cāṇakya, “At the very least, I would need to send a messenger to their tax collectors to send their taxes to me instead of to their king. What would happen then?”<br>“You’d be laughed at,” says Pabbata.<br>“Indeed, for they have no reason to comply. Suppose that I threatened to execute them if they didn’t comply, or if I offered them a salary to comply. What would happen then?”<br>“You’d still be laughed at, if you are known to have no means of following up on your word. But if you do follow up on your word, the king of Ujjain would capture and punish you for your crime.”<br>“Or at least, they will punish whichever agents I send to carry out these activities. So the king of Ujjain is doing something I do not wish him to do. What do I do when I wish to change someone’s behaviour to my liking?”<br>“The doctrine of sāma-dāma-daṇḍa-bheda (persuasion, purchase, punishment, deceit),” Śrībhānu recalled. “You will employ these means to cause the king of Ujjain to do your bidding.”<br>Pabbata smirks. “Good luck with that. The king of Ujjain is a viceroy of Magadha.”<br>“These discussions are theoretical,” says Cāṇakya sternly. “Can you tell me which of these four methods I will use, and how?”<br>“You could hardly persuade the king or the tax collectors to pay you taxes,” says Pāṇini, “Bribing someone to give you money hardly sounds sensible. I suppose you could deceive them by bribing some cart drivers and border guards—”<br>“Recall that I am not merely attempting a one-time plunder,” says Cāṇakya, “I wish to have the right to tax the land, as recognized by its people, so that I can do so unopposed and peacefully.”<br>“You would punish the king of Ujjain,” said Daṇḍaśarman. “Or threaten him with punishment.”<br>One method of such punishment is assassination. Indeed, this is what has been constantly occurring in Magadha as we speak. Yet, the king may be too well-guarded to easily assassinate, or the king’s ministers may have decision-making power, and they may not care so much about the health of the king as they do of the health of the country. Or I may be worried of the king attempting a counter-assassination on myself, and for a king endowed with wealth, that may have a greater chance of success.<br>Thus I wish to harass the country of Avanti in order to have them do my bidding.<br>What is the best way to harass a country?<br>There are two forms of harassment: generic harassment, with the understanding that it will stop if they submit to my will, or targeted harassment, that specifically punishes the action that I wish to forbid. The latter is preferable if I only wish to conquer a portion of their country, or if I wish to force them into accepting a treaty on trade and such; the former is preferable if I wish to conquer their entire country.<br>Generic harassment takes many forms: assassinations and kidnappings of important officials, robbing treasuries, capturing territories other than the desired one as hostage, destructive acts such as burning countries, plundering cities and poisoning water sources, blocking of trade routes and food supplies.<br>Targeted harassment involves battles. Battle may emerge between the army I send to rob their treasuries and the army they send in defence of it, and then such battles may escalate as each side sends reinforcements. Such battles are to be avoided, as they are unplanned – instead, the conqueror must plan in advance and send an army of the size and composition that will eventually be needed. Secretive methods may also be employed to aid a battle.<br>When the costs the conqueror imposes through these methods exceeds the costs of surrender for the defender, the conqueror wins.<br>An expedition should only be undertaken if its expected profit – from gathered taxes and loot, concern for the welfare of the conquered people, precautionary cause, strategic cause – exceeds its costs.<br>Thus, a war whose outcome is known in advance to both sides should never be fought.<br>Thus, all warfare is deception.<br>To harass a country – plunder its cities, burn its fields, capture its leaders, and so on – one needs to place an army in the midst of that country. Routes are too easily blocked, and mobilizing armies is costly and time-consuming, thus the necessity to establish or capture forts. Similarly, a defender needs forts to mobilize one’s army more easily, and to be able to pinch direct attacks in the centre of the country. For one large lion can be fought, but it is much harder to fight a pack of wolves that surrounds you on all sides.<br>A defender may judge that instead of retreating to a fort, he may defeat the attacker’s army in battle before it reaches the fort. This may be advised if the defender can find a location for battle that favours him, such as a river crossing or certain terrain, as these act as forts of their own sorts. But forts are preferred, as they can be designed by men to function as desired, much as agriculture is desired to hunting and gathering fruits in the forest. Thus the conqueror should also establish military camps.<br>“I will pose to you a question,” says Cāṇakya, “Why don’t conquerors simply focus on capturing the capital through an assassination, rather than make extensive efforts to capture bordering cities and forts?”<br>“Kings tend to be well-guarded?” Daṇḍaśarman suggests.<br>“Pabbata,” asks Cāṇakya, “What would happen if I were to assassinate Dhanānanda?”<br>“You would quickly be executed by Sakadala, and Augraseniya would be appointed Emperor,” Pabbata answers.<br>“What if, instead of assassinating Dhanānanda, I entered Magadha territory and somehow raised a local army and laid siege to Pāṭaliputra?”<br>“Then the surrounding forts loyal to the emperor would surround and destroy your army.”<br>“Those are similar outcomes,” Apratimaujas observes, “If you attack the emperor, his allies within the palace will destroy you; if you attack the palace, the armies of the city will attack you; if you attack the city, the armies of the country will attack you; if you attack the country, the armies of the vassals will attack you; and if you attack the empire, the armies of the allies will attack you.”<br>“So one must know where to attack from,” Candragupta considers, “Weighing the quickness of a direct attack against the unopposed nature of an attack from the outside?”<br>“Not exactly,” says Cāṇakya, “An attack from the inside must also fight all those who attempt to stop him, as must an attack from the outside. However, an attack from the inside may cause the conqueror to be more easily surrounded, and thus poses a strategic disadvantage in terms of positioning. Can anyone state the more general point I am trying to demonstrate?”<br>“That the conqueror’s victory depends on acquiring the loyalties of each of the defender’s elements of sovereignty,” says Apratimaujas, “The allies’ loyalties depend on their belief as to who will emerge victorious; yet your victory depends on the allies’ loyalties.”<br>“It is akin to the problem of teaching Scythians the Civilized Tongue,” says Candragupta.<br>“It is akin to a self-fulfilling prophecy,” says Pāṇini.<br>Indeed, the art of war is the art of commanding the loyalties of the elements of sovereignty. There are many methods to do acquire the loyalties of the enemy’s elements.<br>If the conqueror already possesses a greater degree of sovereignty than the defender – such as through a sufficiently larger army, wealthier treasury, larger or superior country, or a king and minister that govern with greater intellect – then that alone is sufficient to acquire the elements, as the enemy is aware that an attempt to oppose the conqueror can be punished effectively by the conqueror.<br>If the conqueror is starting with little, then he must employ many cunning methods to acquire these elements. For example, he may pretend to have acquired an ally to acquire another ally, and vice versa to acquire the first ally. Or he may sow dissension within the enemy’s country to weaken the enemy’s command over his own elements, thus allowing even a weak king to conquer the country. Or he may take the support of a new ally entirely.<br>Such methods are diverse and require creativity, they cannot simply be taught through lecture. I will eventually, through the means of various games, teach you to independently suggest such methods when necessary.<br>A particular method to create self-fulfilling prophecies is the manipulation of the enemy’s morale. This is the purpose of motivating an army through speeches, of demoralizing the enemy’s army, of slaying commanders, of planting flags on fortresses, of writing declarations of war and independence, of fabricating bad omens, of creating false genealogies and prophecies, of seeking verbal endorsement from distinguished Brāhmaṇas, and of performing the _Aśvamedha ritual.<br>No individual soldier needs to be motivated by the speech, yet the collective of all soldiers is motivated by it, as each individual soldier will think, “As this king has given this speech, all my compatriots will be more loyal to him, and thus he has a greater chance of succeeding, and when he does succeed, I shall be rewarded if I am loyal to him now”, and all his compatriots think the same. Similarly, no enemy soldier needs to be superstitious for a bad omen to demoralize him, for he need only think “All my compatriots will be demoralized by this bad omen, thus the enemy will win, thus I will benefit from betraying my king”, and all his compatriots think the same.<br>This is also why houses are built in accordance with the principles of Vāstu, for each man thinks “If I purchase a house not in accordance with such principles, no one will buy it from me”, and even if no one man believes in these principles, men will believe in it as a collective.<br>I will make some comments on how such methods may be executed successfully.<br>The pronouncement of inspiring speeches can be compared to flirtations between a man and an unchaste woman. Each soldier is afraid to immediately proclaim his loyalty by crying “Victory to the Great King!”, as his compatriots may not share this feeling, and indeed they will not, as each of them thinks the same. Instead, he may express interest in the king’s words, put on an expression of high morale, breath and stand in an inspired manner, and applaud the king with a cry or through gestures, in that order, all as he observes similar signals from his compatriots. The process may also be aided by taking in confidence beforehand particular soldiers of decent repute to cry “Victory to the Great King!” in order to pressure their compatriots to do the same.<br>The key to turning loyalties is to make oneself distinguished in some way; it does not matter which way. For example, a relative of the king, the minister or general, a subjugated house or vassal state, an imprisoned or exiled king of an extinguished line all have a greater chance of conquering a country than does an ordinary man. People are also more likely to follow men distinguished by their wealth, scholarship, high birth and fame. That is why when a prince of a king may even conquer the capital directly, while an external king would likely fail in this mission unless he appoints a local governor as his vassal.<br>One way to avoid betrayal, whether intentional or by such tactics, is to associate with allies of good repute, such as ancient noble lines that will defend the honour of their word with their lives, or with mercenary clans of good repute, or with close and reliable friends with character that can be personally appraised.<br>Similarly to prevent attacks on his own army’s morale, a king must train his soldiers and other government servants to a protocol. This is known as “discipline”.<br>When attacking a disciplined army, a conqueror must expose them to unexpected situations that they have not been trained a protocol for.<br>Thus each possible situation must be anticipated and effective protocols must be developed to be followed in these situations.<br>To develop the best counter-play to the enemy, a king must also gather information about the enemy, such as of the size and composition of his army, and the tactics he may employ. This is ascertained with scouts and spies. For example, the composition of one’s army must reflect what is needed to oppose the other’s army, such as the use of archers against infantry, and the use of cavalry against archers; as must the fortifications and location of battle.<br>If both parties had complete knowledge of the other’s army and sent the best army to oppose it, the result would be heavy bloodshed on both sides.<br>Thus all warfare is deception.<br>Discipline also has its disadvantages, as following orders may lead men off a cliff. Thus, per the needs of the situation, a king may employ mercenaries, or entertain his own soldiers as mercenaries by placing bounties on the achievement of certain goals, such as slaying a commander. Bounties on the achievement of greater goals, like seizing a fortress, may be offered to organized mercenary clans rather than to individual soldiers.<br>For completeness, I shall discuss the method of Dharmayuddha.<br>It is observed among some wild beasts that when they fight among themselves, they fight with their paws sheathed. Even though unsheathing their paws would allow them a greater chance to succeed, doing so will also prompt their enemy to unsheathe their paws, causing a great deal of destruction to both sides. Thus the beasts silently agree on certain rules of what is foul and what is not.<br>Similar observations can be made about pitched duels between princes.<br>Similar observations can be made about debates between scholarly Brāhmaṇas.<br>Similarly, two enemies may agree beforehand to fight on a particular battlefield at a specified time, to only bring certain weapons or an army of certain size to the fight, to obey certain rules during the battle, to surrender a predefined objective upon defeat in this battle, to not depose the defeated king but to reinstate him as ruler subject to certain acceptable conditions, and so on. Such rules are followed by clans in the interest of preserving their reputation.<br>As it is only kṣatriya warriors who may be expected to uphold such rules, armies of vast numbers cannot be raised by employing peasant soldiers in such battles. Thus such battles cannot be fought against tribes such as the Scythians that conscript entire populations into their armies. Nor can such rules be followed while fighting against Western tribes whose army compositions are vastly different from those of civilized states, or against tribes that have no reputation to uphold, or against tribes of poor reputation.<br>Following rules that your enemy doesn’t follow is suicide with extra steps.<br>Thus Kutayuddha is of great importance when fighting against barbarians.<br>As an exercise, you shall explain why states are nearly always contiguous, and what this entails for our assumptions about statecraft.<br>elements<br><br><br>
The king, the minister, the country, the fort, the treasury, the army and the ally are the elements of sovereignty.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 6.1
<br>which_is_better_2<br><br><br>
Which is better, a friend of vast population, or a friend of immense gold? My teacher says that a friend of vast population is better inasmuch as such a friend will be of imposing power and can, when he rises up, accomplish any work undertaken. Not so, says Kautilya: a friend possessing immense gold is better; for possession of gold is ever desirable; but an army is not always required. Moreover armies and other desired objects can be purchased for gold.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 7.9:26-30
<br>which_is_better_3<br><br><br>
Which is better, a friend possessing gold, or a friend possessing vast territory? My teacher says that a friend possessing gold can stand any heavy expenditure made with discretion. Not so, says Kautilya: for it has already been stated that both friends and gold can be acquired by means of territory. Hence a friend of vast territory is far better.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 7.9:31-34
<br>adverserial<br><br><br>
Hence one should recruit one’s army, reflecting that “such is the army of my enemy; and this is my army to oppose it.” Considering the strength of the constituents of one’s own quadripartite army, one should recruit men to it so as to oppose an enemy’s army successfully.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 9.2:26-30
<br>profit_loss<br><br><br>
Loss of trained men is what is called kshaya. Diminution of gold and grains is loss of wealth. When the expected profit overweighs both these; then one should march (against an enemy).
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 9.4:1-3
<br>debt<br><br><br>
When a profit is easily acquired and secured without the necessity of returning it to others, it is termed “receivable”; that which is of the reverse nature is “repayable”; whoever goes to receive a repayable profit or enjoys such a profit, is destroyed.
However, if one thinks that “by taking a repayable profit I shall cause my enemy’s treasury, army, and other defensive resources to dwindle; I shall exploit to impoverishment the mines, timber and elephant forests, irrigational works and roads of traffic of my enemy; I shall impoverish his subjects, or cause them to migrate, or conspire against him; when they are reduced to this condition, my enemy inflames their hatred (by punishing them); or I shall set my enemy against another enemy; my enemy will give up his hopes and run away to one who has some blood-relationship with him; or having improved his lands, I shall return them to him, and when he is thus brought to ascendancy, he will be a lasting friend of mine,” then he may take even a repayable profit.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 9.4:5-8

 <br><br>Takṣaśilā was losing.<br>It was as if dark clouds had formed over the arena at Śalātura, yet such clouds that passed without providing rainfall.<br>Victory after victory, the university, with all its scholars and students, had forgotten the feeling of defeat.<br>In the nearly four hundred years of the Annual Debates held in the honour of the ancient philosopher Yājñavalkya, from whose works all schools of thought had birthed, the site and sponsors of the debates had changed numerous times, but the contest had remained the most prestigious of such events for scholars and students alike; its pride and prestige remaining unchallenged even by the Royal Debates of Gandhāra.<br>Scholars would pour in year after year, coveting the contest’s generous prizes, and wealthy families fought for the honour of sponsoring it, just as cities competed for the glory of hosting the debate.<br>The university currently held a twenty-year winning streak, but this year, after reaching the finals, found itself dangerously close to losing its crown to the Sauvīrāyana University in Sindh.<br>Nothing – nothing – could have been more humiliating! The Mūṣikas, the descendants of sea nomads from Aparānta who had settled in Sindh, merchants who had once been entrenched in practices like piracy, who bore the banner of a rat, their joke of a university was merely an inferior imitation of Takṣaśilā’s.<br>It was not because the sponsor, the wealthy merchant Valgujangha, himself a Mūṣika merchant who had received his education at the Sauvīrāyana University – to the contrary, Valgujangha’s repute for fairness in all his business dealings was matched only by his honesty and truthfulness.<br>No. As the final contestants warred with words in the central arena, it became very obvious that Takṣaśilā had grown complacent in its position. Its representative, the seventeen-year-old student Śuśrava, was obviously woefully unprepared and lacking in clarity of thought – stumbling over his words, he allowed himself to be completely dominated by Pratikṣatra, the older man who represented Sauvīrāyana.<br>Curious and wide-eyed, an eleven-year-old Greek girl watched from the back of the great ampitheatre.<br>Between heroism and discipline, which quality is more desirable in an army? That was the question.<br>“Infused with valour, a skilful warrior may slay hundreds from atop his chariot,” said Pratikṣatra, “For of a man who knows no duty but that of war, surrender does not even cross his mind.”<br>“I hold that to be impossible, O respected Professor,” Śuśrava objected, his voice nearly a squeak, “For such feats as are quoted in accounts – of an archer piercing thousands of armoured men with a single arrow, or a soldier crushing the skulls of half an army with a swing of his mace – cannot truly be realistic, as they defy reason.”<br>Pratikṣatra smiled concedingly. “Indeed the precise numbers may be bardic exaggeration,” he allowed, “But the fact remains that some warriors were exalted for their incredible skill and competence, and raised above others in the minds of their followers – thus my stance: that it is such qualities that a commander must inculcate in his army, rather than discipline.”<br>Śuśrava took a full half-minute to respond. (murmurs could be heard of boys going “I could do such a better job!” and “Śuśrava lacks force”)<br>Finally, he admitted: “Such warriors are to be honoured. I’m afraid, however, O respected Professor, that the Age of Heroes has long passed. The present is the Age of Empires, and imperial armies function on discipline more than bravery. It is not courage, but the ability of a commander to strategize effectively, that allows small armies to defeat great ones.”<br>&nbsp;It was not unheard of for a Greek to receive an education in India.<br>Two centuries ago, Pythagoras, the son of a wealthy man from Samos, had spent some years at Takṣaśilā. He had learned from the scholars here the laws of mathematics and music, and to introspect on the mind and on the meaning and causes of knowledge (a study he later gave the name “philosophy”). Donning simple robes and rejecting meat as learned Indians did, he brought these ideas back with him to Greece, and thus the light of Classical Greece was lit by the torch of India.<br>“Why is the Age of Heroes past us?” Pratikṣatra questioned. “Surely it is human actions, and not the intervention of gods, that has lead to the dearth of heroes. You are young and naive, Śuśrava, but it must be said, that is this very discipline that you exalt, that has crushed the heroism of the kṣatriyas. In commanding them to conform to those rules that their superiors have set for them, we deprive them of the skill for intrigue, of their capacity to plan in situations not yet anticipated. And thus our dark times were born.”<br>It was also not unheard of for a woman to receive an education in India.<br>Indeed, even in the earliest days, among the first debaters against Yājñavalkya himself had been the firebrand princess Maitreyi – who had questioned him on matters of afterlife and immortality and later became his wife – and Vācaknavī, who had debated him on pertinent questions on the natural sciences.<br>Nonetheless, both occurrences were relatively rare, and the result of odd circumstances.<br>In the case of Thera, that circumstance was the untimely death of both her parents in a domestic squabble after her mother Laodice had claimed, to her father Antiochus’s distaste, that her children were sired by the god Apollo. Of course, the terming of this circumstances as “odd” or “unusual” was questionable: in Macedon, the men were violent, the women were insane, everyone was perpetually drunk, and glassware was abundant.<br>While it was still not at all usual to send away an eleven-year-old girl away from family to study in the East, her brother Seleucus had been worried about her being used as a hostage during the political violence in Greece surrounding subsequent troubles in the Macedonian noble family – much of such affairs he himself was involved in.<br>She had been admitted alongside a class of Persian students who studied various arts of Persia and India – however, upon arriving at Takṣaśilā, she had found herself more drawn to studying the sciences of the Indian philosophers, and so she had abandoned her living quarters in Puṣkalāvatī to stay within the campus of the University of Takṣaśilā itself, as the relatively studious Indians did.<br>“But the capacity to plan in situations not yet anticipated is precisely the argument for discipline,” Śuśrava argued. “Discipline is the art of developing solutions in anticipation of problems instead of in reaction to them, and based on such considerations developing protocols to follow that will then be adhered to rigidly, and ensure victory.”<br>Upon arriving at Takṣaśilā, she had quickly heard tales of Cāṇakya, the Golden Boy of Takṣaśilā, who was currently away, for at least one and a half fortnights, on a dangerous expedition to Magadha.<br>In all honesty, she found most of the viewpoints attributed to him to be so outrageous that it would be no exaggeration to say that merely hearing such opinions expressed had left her scarred for life. She took great objection to his thesis that “wealth and wealth alone is important”, his defence of usury went completely against the teachings of Aristotle that she had held so sacred, and his apparent neutrality between many systems of government seemed plainly amoral.<br>Yet it was hard not to develop an admiration for his brilliance.<br>“A strategist cannot anticipate every possible outcome in battle,” Pratikṣatra retorted harshly, “Nor every trap that the enemy may institute in the midst of the battle. Thus it is necessary for this onus to fall on the individual soldier, to think for himself in the absence of, or in spite of orders. An army that possesses discipline alone is merely a phalanx of blind men walking off the edge of a cliff.”<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>The crowd watched.<br>A wave of dejection had washed over the crowd from Takṣaśilā – many of its younger members, who had never seen their university defeated in contest, found it inconceivable to so much as imagine what was unfolding before their very eyes.<br>“ … ”<br>Śuśrava bowed his head.<br>There was a collective intake of breath from the audience – scholars, students, merchants, nobles, peasants who had climbed the trees surrounding the amphitheatre to watch the iconic debates.<br>The despair was palpable.<br>Even Thera, who was new to the university and to India, who did not yet fully grasp or relate to all its ways, understood the significance of the gesture.<br>It was the end of an era.<br>“You have convinced me of the truth of your viewpoint,” said Śuśrava. “I had in my naivety, dismissed the entire enterprise of heroism as chaotic and based in emotion rather than reason. I had not considered the intellectual and strategic aspects of heroism—” he breathed in deeply, “—I concede.”<br>Not one man spoke.<br>Not one student from Takṣaśilā, not one student from Sauvīrāyana.<br>There was no ritual exchange of congratulatory pleasantries.<br>For those of Sauvīrāyana were proud – but to be merry, to rejoice, when those of Takṣaśilā stood humiliated – like a defeated army watching their capital city ravaged before their very eyes – like a farmer watching his fields burn to a day before the harvest – would have been the act of a barbarian.<br>An eternity followed.<br>Valgujangha rose at last, preparing to break the silence. Solemn and ceremonial, he addressed the attendees—<br>—just as a young voice cried out from somewhere near the East door: “I do not!”<br>Gasps. Elation on the faces of the Takṣaśilā boys, and dread on the Sauvīrāyana ones’.<br>Even as she did not recognize the voice herself, Thera inferred, from the sudden reinvigoration in her classmates, and the name Cāṇakya formed on her lips.<br>Students from across the amphitheatre scrambled, shuffled in place, to make way for the golden boy of Takṣaśilā – their faces red and their hearts beating.<br>“Cā-ṇa-kya! – Cā-ṇa-kya!”<br>Passionate informal drumming deafened her ears, and Thera had to lean on her toes to peer past the rows of heads, still catching but a quick glimpse.<br>Cāṇakya rode in on a horse, flanked by two boys too regally dressed to be attendants, and yet acted as if they were his. He did not tie his hair into a top-bun as was the standard for students at Takṣaśilā, instead leaving it untied, and his dhoti had taken a silvery-white hue.<br>“Forgive me, Lord,” he said, dismounting, “My visit to Pāṭaliputra involved a number of unforeseen detours – I request your permission to represent my university in the debates of the last day.”<br>Thera could hardly imagine so much pomp in the citadel of Corinth if Poseidon himself rose from the sea in mid-noon.<br>Valgujangha was smiling, but his assistant called for order in the crowd, and the students (as well as some particularly excitable professors) slowly began to return to their places.<br>“This is the final debate, Cāṇakya. Do you wish for a summary of the arguments made so far by each side?”<br>Cāṇakya grinned in amusement.<br>“I predict,” he said, inhaling deeply as if to relax, “That my opponent’s arguments are as follows: warriors used to be more powerful in the Age of Heroes than they are now, that’s because discipline reduces creativity and valour, and commanders can’t predict the various outcomes of battle thus soldiers must be capable of making decisions individually on their own accord—”<br>Thera’s jaw dropped. The crowd exploded into cheers of amazement, prompting the attendant to hush them once again.<br>“—he has surely also made the tired analogy of a disciplined army to a phalanx of men blindly walking off a cliff even as they see its edge, and made the claim that a rigidly defined army can be defeated as it cannot adapt to its enemy.”<br>Pratikṣatra shifted awkwardly. “In all honesty, I did not think of the last point.”<br>Cāṇakya looked quite proud of himself.<br>“Well,” he addressed the Professor, “Perhaps I should then also formulate your own rebuttals before you make them, then I would have a worthy opponent.”<br>The crowd erupted into cheers. This time it was Cāṇakya who hushed them.<br>“Instead of addressing each one of your points,” he said, “I shall begin with a general observation about the nature of your arguments, and indeed of many debaters who hold incorrect stances on questions stated in of the form of comparisons. It is as if you have, instead of defeating your opponent in a swordfight, defeated a cripple of your own creation claiming – and successfully convincing the audience and even your opponent – that cripple to be your opponent.<br>“In all your arguments, you have assumed the image, for I cannot even call it a defining characteristic, of a disciplined army as one that follows a certain small set of rigid and simplistic rules. You have assumed the image of a heroic army as one comprised of valiant and creative soldiers. Between these two, I have no doubt that the latter is superior. However, this is not what is commonly meant by these terms.”<br>“Your rebuttal is merely a game of semantics, Cāṇakya,” said Pratikṣatra proudly, “Surely fire by any other name burns just as hot.”<br>“Indeed, you may call your mother poison and obesity edible, but that would not enable one to safely consume poison. If the objective of such arguments was merely a play with invented words, then your argument would be valid, as well as completely trivial. But the purpose of thought is action, and you expect your arguments to apply to the more common meanings of these terms. In doing so, you behave like a merchant who secures a large deal by promising silk fabrics, but instead delivers cotton or linen apparel – or like a policeman who is told to execute a man by a certain name, but not finding the criminal, gives that name to an innocent civilian and executes him – or like a preacher who describes his religion in vague platitudes, and demands your blood from you once you join his cult – or like a scholar of a misguided school who says that in his ideal form of government, people will act very nobly and charitably, yet does not specify at all how his plans will cause them to do so – or like a legislator who, in his argument to forbid a practice, uses only its most wicked manifestations as examples for his rhetorics, even as his own proposed laws do not prevent such evil. In short: your arguments are the intellectual equivalent of fraud.”<br>The faces of all those of Takṣaśilā – including Thera herself, she imagined – shone with a wordless emotion: like the faces of a routed army watching its champion ride into battle in full metal armour to turn the tides of war – like the faces of the gods when Viṣṇu rose to defend them – or like the face of the Earth goddess when Brahmā descended to rescue her – manifesting like dawn at the night’s darkest.<br>Rather ironic comparisons, Thera thought, as Cāṇakya was literally arguing against the importance of heroism.<br>Pratikṣatra pressed on. “Your analogies are merely insults,” he complained, “You have not explained how I have committed this fallacy you claim.”<br>Cāṇakya smiled wryly. “Surely you are a scholar of repute yourself, and recognize the mistakes in your argument when they are pointed at to you? But I shall spell it out. When people speak of a heroic army, they do not state any plan that will cause the individual soldiers of an army to act in a creative or valiant manner – instead, they simply propose the elimination of discipline and claim that this will miraculously cause this outcome, even as this is contradicted by history – for though we deride the Magadhas as barbarians, in part precisely for their disciplined armies, it remains true that they were able to completely annihilate the relatively undisciplined armies of the states to its West.”<br>“Surely you realize, Cāṇakya, that prior to the introduction of discipline, all such demonstrations of heroism were common and widespread among the armies of the Mahājanapada states?”<br>“There are many levels on which your argument can be refuted. Firstly, one may say that you have no way to demonstrate that this change was caused by the introduction of discipline. Second, one may point out the military successes of Magadha against the other states. But a more fundamental refutation is possible. While my classmate likely made claims to the effect of – heroic armies were suited for the Age of Heroes, but that glorious age is lost to us now, thus as we must make do with iron for the age of gold is lost to us, we must make do with disciplined imperial armies – in truth, there never was an Age of Heroes—”<br>Thera gasped, then shut her mouth when she got some weird looks.<br>“—for such an age is not found in the Vedas, merely in the poetry of bards. The Battle of the Ten kings was not won by warriors who slew ten times their own number, it was won by the cunning of Sage Vasiṣhta who opened a dam to flood and kill off much of the unsuspecting enemy armies before the battle even began, and who shrewdly placed, in a manner that did not raise suspicion among scouts and spies, his own army into position to attack on command during the enemy’s rescue operations. The latter is certainly the exercise of discipline.”<br>The unbashed anti-romanticism of such words. It was shocking that they were even legal.<br>Thera felt rather conflicted – on one hand, she wished to interrupt Cāṇakya and object to his damning rejection of the very existence of the Age of Heroes (surely it existed in Greece, and if the Indians had a similar story of such an age it must have existed in India too – why was the existence of something so sacred even up for debate?) – but on the other hand, despite having attended Takṣaśilā for less than a month, she too felt the jingoistic fever that had permeated the crowd since Cāṇakya’s arrival. Cāṇakya was a hero, his arrival a miracle to Takṣaśilā in its darkest of nights. To question him there was like including, in a prayer for rain, a criticism of Zeus’s treatment of Prometheus.<br>Even Pratikṣatra appeared to have lost all confidence at this point, merely pressing on to introduce an honourable delay to his inevitable surrender.<br>“Surely it follows from reason,” he argued, “That instilling a standard protocol discourages a warrior from thinking for himself?”<br>“How, precisely, would you ensure that soldiers do think for themselves in the midst of battle? Perhaps by educating them earlier on the art of solving problems? And such an education would include practice problems, of course – cases one may encounter in battle, and instruction on the optimal strategy for such cases. If only we had a name for such an education.” Cāṇakya smiled. “The difference between an undisciplined army and a disciplined army is not that the former thinks for itself and the latter doesn’t, it’s that the former is forced to come up with solutions on the spot, as beasts must, rather than strategize in advance, as men do. You believe, wishfully, that each of your soldiers will think for themselves on the battlefield, even as you have no means to ensure it – just as you believe wishfully that each of your soldiers will slay ten of your enemy’s, but that this will not be true of your enemy’s valour.”<br>“Your characterization is an insult to the great heroes of history and legend, like Arjuna, Rama, and Viṣṇu,” said Pratikṣatra.<br>Heracles, Odysseus, Achilles. Thera had to stop herself from vigorously nodding.<br>“And I may similarly say that you insult the great strategists of history,” replied Cāṇakya, “Like Vasiṣṭha, Krishna, Viṣṇu too, Saṃkarṣaṇa and his heirs – or, for reasons aforementioned, that the rejection of discipline in warfare is a rejection of the intellect, and therefore of Puruṣa himself. But I am not interested in the game of compliments and insults, as that is a game of gossip, and therefore is a concern of women, not of scholars.”<br>Thera observed the shift in Pratikṣatra’s tone and posture of argument. He had abandoned his earlier pompous rhetoric, choosing instead a defensive position against Cāṇakya, and once that too had failed, he had attacked Cāṇakya on the basis of the morality of his stance. Even as she likely agreed with him on matters of policy, she had to confess that this was telling of a fundamental insincerity.<br>In a final attempt, Pratikṣatra adopted yet another appearance: one of wisdom and calm temparement.<br>“How blissful it is,” he said, “To be young and believe one knows everything. I must relish the nostalgia. You have studied under the Professors at Takṣaśilā, Cāṇakya, and have believed their words to be truth – but I could name you tens of more experienced scholars at Sauvīrāyana and elsewhere, who have discussed at length the value of heroism over discipline, and the disaster that discipline has spelled for the kṣatriya race.”<br>Cāṇakya gave a wry smile in response, that alone sufficed to rescue the university from a historic humiliation, and to secure Takṣaśilā its twenty-first consecutive victory at the Yājñavalkya Debates.<br>“Tens of scholars?” he asked. “I only need two: myself, and the goddess Vāc, who smiles down upon me when I speak the truth.”<br>truth_win<br><br><br>
A covetous man may be won by means of a gift, an obstinate man by folded hands in salutation, a fool by humouring him – but a learned man can only be won by the truth.

<br>The celebration was cut short by a commotion at the perimeter of the gathering.<br>Thera squeezed her way through the crowd, and saw a gory scene before her.<br>A young boy, dirty and unkempt – apparently not a student at any gurukula – had his right arm outstretched, the palm of his hand dripping with blood.<br>He was not crying or even cringing in pain – instead, he defiantly held the gaze of Professor Ṛṣyaśṛṅga, who stood taken aback.<br>She stood frozen, unsure what to even do. The boy clearly needed aid, and yet he seemed not to care, no one had acted, not even the Professor—<br>—“Fetch Doctor Ugraśravas!” The voice belonged to Cāṇakya, who had just broken through the crowd, as he delegated instructions, then tore a piece off someone’s dhoti and started wrapping the kid’s hand.<br>“What happened?” he pressed.<br>The boy winced for the first time, at the pressure applied to his hand.<br>But when he replied, his voice was steady.<br>“I told Professor Ṛṣyaśṛṅga that I wished to study at Takṣaśilā,” he stated. “That I wished to be his student. The Professor declined, telling me the knowledge-line on my palm was not deep enough. I did not know which line that was, so I carved all of them with a knife.”<br>Cāṇakya held the boy’s gaze for a full half-minute.<br>“That intelligence resides behind the forehead, not on the palm, is known to all men who possess any of it. What is your name, child?”<br>“Pāṇini,” said the boy.<br>“From today, Pāṇini,” Cāṇakya announced, “You are my student.”<br>education<br><br><br>
The life of an uneducated man is as useless as the tail of a dog which neither covers its rear end, nor protects it from the bites of insects.
—Kautilya, according to the Cāṇakya Nītiśāstra
<br>It was only after returning to Takṣaśilā that Thera was able to catch up to Cāṇakya during dinner.<br>She introduced herself, then said: “I had some objections to what you said at the debate, but didn’t wish to betray you and the university by interrupting you mid-speech.”<br>“Oh?” Cāṇakya started. “You should have. If you were to defeat me now, my win would be tainted.”<br>“I was unaware,” she said shamefully. “I’m new to Takṣaśilā, and am not familiar with what’s considered polite.”<br>Cāṇakya, for all his apparent haughtiness from afar, said something fairly decent for once: “Do whatever is right, and no one will be offended in Takṣaśilā. Honesty is what we regard as polite; dishonesty is the gravest insult.”<br>“That’s good advice,” Thera confessed.<br>A short pause followed, during which Cāṇakya seemed rather annoyed. “Did you merely wish to mention that you have objections to what I said, or do you wish to debate me on them?”<br>Feeling embarrassed, she gathered her thoughts, and expressed them in so many words, focusing specifically on how upsetting his nay-saying rejection of the “Age of Heroes” was.<br>To which Cāṇakya said: “None of your objections have anything to do with the truth of my statements, and merely to do with how upsetting they are to you. To hold a value more sacred than the truth is to dishonour the goddess Sarasvati.” Furthermore, he explained, if wars were run on heroism alone, such heroism would be rather dull in itself, for the only job of a commander would be to maximize such spirits among his soldiers; it would not allow the plays and outplays – or the rock-paper-scissors – of strategic war. Indeed, he said, disciplined war merely made the strategist the hero, and such heroism was actually effective in large scale as the proponents of heroism claimed their own methods to be.<br>Thera then brought up yet another point of contention she had with what she had heard of Cāṇakya’s views, namely with his thesis that wealth and wealth alone is important. She explained that there were many things that couldn’t be bought with wealth, which he seemed to neglect.<br>This seemed to amuse Cāṇakya greatly, who asked: “I take it that your family is wealthy?”<br>“Very,” Thera admitted, feeling a little attacked.<br>“It is only those born to wealth who do not understand its value, only those born with great intelligence who cannot comprehend what cognitive capacities they possess that others do not, and it is beautiful women who downplay the importance of being well-formed or shower dishonest praise on the beauty of their uglier friends. There is a great deal that wealth can buy, and wealth is an encapsulation of the deeds of a man – for a man earns wealth by giving goods to his clients, and loses wealth by taking goods from sellers. There are indeed goods that money cannot buy, but an honest man must find it upsetting that such goods cannot be bought by money, and think of methods to make such goods purchasable to money, rather than celebrate such goods for their inability to be purchased by money.”<br>Thera raised more questions, about usury and other matters, and Cāṇakya must have grown tired of the smalltalk, because he then said: “If you truly believe the things you say, you wouldn’t be so easily convinced by my single-point arguments without any further questioning, because you would have thought through these beliefs more thoroughly. I suspect that your true intention here has nothing to do with the topics you profess to care about, but rather to talk to me, such as to extract some favour or to merely make my acquaintance.”<br>Thera felt humiliated. Cāṇakya had humoured her so far like a friend, but perhaps she had pushed it too far at the end and caused him to adopt a stricter position as a professor and all. She recalled his earlier words: Honesty is what we regard as polite; Dishonesty is the gravest insult, and decided to be forthright:<br>“Forgive me for my insincerity. I learned that you will soon become a Professor and have your own gurukula. I greatly respect your intellect, and wish to be your student.”<br>Cāṇakya declined emphatically. Thera’s heart sank.<br>“Although,” he said, “If you do just merely to make my acquaintance, I happen to need a wife for my graduation ceremony.”<br>Thera laughed, a little red, but then realized he may be serious, and that he might consider the child marriage of a “barbarian” girl – even one of such noble birth as herself – to be completely morally acceptable.<br>“If I may press further,” she asked, trying to keep the desperation out of her voice, “Why will you not accept me as a student?”<br>“I believe you do not quite understand the quality of students that I am taking for my gurukula,” said Cāṇakya. “You are a student of the Persian arts, a discipline imposed on us by the imperial government, that is taken by princes lacking in intelligence and masculinity, to which admission is gained by uttering a few insincere words of flattery to the Persians.”<br>Not wishing to be deterred so easily, Thera insisted: “But I am trying to switch to an Indian education in the sciences—” she leaned forward conspiratorially, “—and between you and me, I, and the Greeks in general, share the Indian opinion of the Persians. I do not have any words of flattery for them in my mind.”<br>“I’m sure that you, and the Greeks in general, also agree with the Indian opinion on the proper method to wash oneself after defecating—”<br>“—actually, we don’t agree on that—”<br>“—but it is through discussing disagreement, not agreement, that the progress of the world is achieved. Agreement is the consequence, not the cause, of a successful debate that dispels false beliefs on either or both sides.”<br>“I am willing to discuss our disagreements.” Feeling a little brave, she added: “But let me warn you that your perceptions of the Greeks may be quite incorrect. For instance, we have our own great cities, just like India and Persia do, and our own sciences, just like India does.”<br>Cāṇakya gave her a skeptical look, but didn’t seem offended that a foolish barbarian girl had dared to defy him.<br>“There is a tale that is often told of the Greeks,” he said, “As a warning to travellers visiting foreign countries and as a solemn reminder of the superiority of Vedic culture. Of a scholar by the name of Shukrata who was executed in Greece for his political views.”<br>“Socrates’s execution was a tragedy and an indictment of Athenian democracy,” Thera agreed. “But matters have changed now. Socrates’s student’s student, a philosopher by the name of Aristotle, is now employed as a teacher by the royal family that rules Greece.”<br>“If another philosopher were to speak negatively of Socrates, or of this student’s student, would he be executed?”<br>“Without doubt!” Thera replied haughtily, then realized the implication.<br>“Then things haven’t changed at all,” said Cāṇakya. “No more than the welfare of a slave who is passed from one master to another. The Greeks have no law against Brahmahatya, indeed their governments actively engage in that wicked practice – that reason, among others, is why we regard the Greeks as barbarians.”<br>“Indeed,” said Thera. “Just as the wicked practice of widow-burning is why we regard the Indians as barbarians.”<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>Thera was certain that she had crossed a line, and readied herself to prostrate herself and beg for forgiveness, when Cāṇakya cracked a small smile.<br>“Philosophers are more important than widows,” he said at last. “But I will accept you as my student.”<br>envy<br><br><br>
Learned men are envied by the foolish; rich men by the poor; chaste women by adulteresses; and beautiful ladies by ugly ones.

 <br><br>[date:-335|magadha,x]<br>Eighteen months later, Thera received a communication from her brother.<br>Her heart sank to hear the messenger’s words, but such were the restrictions of being of a noble family. Thera had once criticized, during a lecture, the suffocating security measures that Cāṇakya had advocated for the king and royal family, to which he had replied that the nobles were, of course, free to live as ordinary peasants, abandoning both the comforts and responsibilities of noble life.<br>It was at midnight that she woke Cāṇakya.<br>She hesitated, for it was always considered rude to do so (even though he had told her that falsehood was the only thing that caused offense at Takṣaśilā), yet the alternative would have been even less polite.<br>Addressing him respectfully as was typical for such social rituals, she told him of the message and of her departure.<br>Cāṇakya stared sharply in her eyes for a few seconds.<br>Then he asked: “What security concern to you could be more pronounced here in Gandhāra than in Greece?”<br>Thera shrugged helplessly.<br>“How did you guess it is a security concern?” she asked.<br>“Do noble families in Greece typically send their children to hard labour, conscript them to fight in armies, marry them off or sell them to slavery? Are there any disasters about to hit Takṣaśilā that the Greeks are aware of? Have you engaged in any undignified behaviour since arriving at Takṣaśilā that your family may wish you to cease?”<br>Thera smiled a little – a less arrogant man would have thought of, perhaps, education before child labour, marriage, conscription, slavery, prostitution and the apocalypse, but Cāṇakya was so certain (and admittedly correctly so) of the superiority of Takṣaśilā over any institution that could possibly exist in Greece that it was blasphemy to even suggest that Seleucus may have preferred a Greek school to Takṣaśilā.<br>“I suppose that makes sen—wait, how do you know my family is noble?”<br>Cāṇakya waved her question off. “Nonetheless,” he said, “As your Professor and well-wisher, I must advise you to not go. I believe that whatever dangers your family may be wary of, will only be exacerbated by a three-month journey across Persia. I believe I know the cause of your family’s actions, and if I am right in my suspicions, then there may be some in the Persian government who also share these suspicions, and act accordingly.”<br>The fact that Cāṇakya cared enough to want her to stay caused a flurry of emotion in her heart, but she couldn’t even consider disobeying Seleucus, and said so. She looked into Cāṇakya’s eyes to see if he was saddened by her departure, but his face held its usual stoic look.<br>“Very well then,” Cāṇakya said after a short pause, as if he had just finished a quick calculation of the effectiveness of pressing further and decided against it. “As your education is not complete, I believe there are no remaining formalities between us.”<br>It was still odd, even to a girl of noble birth as herself, to hear a boy of her own age speak in such a professorial way about formalities and such.<br>They stayed quiet for a moment.<br>Feeling a cold winter gust, Thera wrapped her toga tighter.<br>“I feel like our conversation ought to be more personable for two friends parting,” she said finally, trying not to sound too emotional. “I do not even know what to say, for the only pleasantry in the Indian language for Chaíre is See you again, while we are parting—most likely forever.”<br>“You may have overestimated that likelihood,” said Cāṇakya, considering.<br>Her face brightened. “You intend to travel to Hellas?”<br>He gave her a very empty expression.<br>Of course not. Of course he would not waste half a year of his life on travel.<br>But he did not clarify, and she did not ask further, even though she desperately wanted to know what it was that he predicted, and instead merely tried not to get her hopes up.<br>The moon was full.<br>“Well,” she spoke, nervously and biting her lip, “Even as tongues may differ, gestures are universal. And this is a universal gesture for Chaíre—”<br>(It was only a brief moment, but it would occupy her thoughts for years on—)<br>“That is not a parting gesture among the Āryas,” said Cāṇakya in a slightly angry tone. “It is a romantic one.”<br>“ … I know.”<br>meal_timing<br><br><br>
But other things the Indians do which one cannot approve: for instance, that they eat always alone, and that they have no fixed hours when meals are to be taken by all in common, but each one eats when he feels inclined. The contrary custom would be better for the ends of social and civil life.
—Megasthenes, according to Strabo XV, i. 53-56, pp. 709-10.
<br>Cāṇakya’s mind was not occupied by fruitless thoughts of romance and personal relationships. Despite the pains it imposed on him to spurn her embrace – as Arjuna had spurned the Matsya princess – Cāṇakya knew that had been right, for there was great value in the restraint of the senses. There was no advantage to childhood romances, as neither the faculties of pleasure nor those of child-bearing were developed at such an age, and since these romances never blossomed into marriage – as the famed cautionary tale of the Śūrasenas attested – they were entirely destructive to the goal of kāma.<br>(Cāṇakya watched Tara speak some words in Greek to the Ājīvaka Professor Varṣākāra’s parrot that she had befriended.)<br>Neither were his thoughts occupied with worry for the political implications of their closeness, for that was a calculation that he had made much earlier. He knew very well that his mere friendship with a Greek girl – even if she had only expressed her affections to him in private and quite late – could potentially be wielded against him by his rivals to throw shade on his motives, or even cause well-meaning allies to be distrustful of the same. Why, that would be the smear campaign that Cāṇakya would have run against himself, had he been in the position of such a rival.<br>I do not comment on whether there is anything wrong in giving education to a barbarian girl, but for a boy who had merely just ended his celibacy, we would be fools to not see the conflict in interest! A learned Brāhmaṇa who so unorthodoxly ends his celibacy in his childhood – why, very possibly for the barbarian girl herself – is that in whom we choose to place our trust? Is there truly no one else whom we can look to as a leader?<br>But he had accepted her as a student despite these implications, for he had immediately judged her to be of noble birth, and as the Greeks bordered on the Western fringe of the Persian empire, her many valuable qualities made her a potentially useful ally. So there were no new revelations on this.<br>No, the boy’s thoughts were occupied with matters of far greater importance.<br>Something big was happening in Greece.<br>Something that Tara did not understand, though her brother certainly did.<br>Something that quite possibly, the Persians themselves did not understand.<br>No internal political trouble could have caused the Greeks to regard their own country as safer for Tara than Gandhāra – no, such a threat had to be foreign. Such a threat had to be Persian.<br>It was a mistake, Cāṇakya realized, to regard the Greeks as simply some distant barbarian tribe – they had their own cities, and until recently, they had been comprised of several countries similar to the Mahājanapadas. But in the most recent generation, the kingdom of Macedon, that Tara belonged to, had embarked on the goal of conquering all of Greece.<br>(The method of ascertaining truth from a person who did not actively wish to lie to you, but may potentially be lying to themselves, was to decide beforehand the answers to what questions were relevant for your purposes, rather than to allow them to state their narrative on their own accord. Thus, Cāṇakya was fairly certain of the truth of what he had learned from Tara.)<br>Persia’s great secret to its stability was that it closely regulated the militias that its vassals could possess, choosing to collect large numbers of troops from them as tribute and thus centralizing its imperial army. This made local rebellions impossible – conversely, it also made them ineffectual in fighting against an external threat.<br>In Āryāvarta, the regions bordering the Persian empire were ruled by disunited mercenary-run states of the Eastern Punjab, which while warlike and unconquerable, were also naturally unwilling to launch a concerted invasion of either bordering empire. The reverse was true in Greece, where Macedon had united the country under an ambitious monarch.<br>The Greeks were planning, in secret, an invasion of Persia.<br>Cāṇakya was certain of it.<br>And that made them his allies.<br>There were two methods of forming alliances. One was the explicit way, secured by words and treaties, or the exchange of hostages. The other was the natural way, for even in the absence of communication between parties, simply by virtue of the parties’ geographical positioning and their motives, the goals of two states may coincide, and their actions may benefit each other.<br>To employ either method, an ambitious statesman had to learn to identify opportunities when they were afforded to him by circumstance, and to avail himself of them.<br>The boy’s eyes, steely in conviction, turned towards the moonless sky, his red dhoti quietly waving in the strong winds resemblant of a royal banner.<br>The game had begun.]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/1/1.11.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/1/1.11.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 14:22:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[2 Mathura Kāṇḍa]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br><br>[date:-334|magadha,x]<br>Pabbata studied his opponent’s stance carefully, his eyes narrowed and his body ready to spring into action at the slightest provocation.<br>Cāṇakya hardly held any interest in teaching duelling for its own sake, of course – duelling was for the weak and the foolish, he’d probably say, for a man possessed of intelligence and strength would employ strategy rather than leave his victory up to a game of chance. Rather, Cāṇakya’s intention was to use these matches as an analogy for real battles: each player had a fortress to defend, represented by a stick in the ground, and was equipped with swords that represented each side’s army, and victory was achieved by either grabbing the opponent’s stick (capturing the enemy fortress) or by laying a single touch on the opponent’s body with one’s sword (destroying the enemy army).<br>A conqueror who simply sprinted to capture the enemy fortress would immediately be cut down by the enemy with his army, as most army formations were easier to attack from the back and the sides than from the front (except the Cakravyūha, which could not be maintained in a mobile state); a force that fled the battlefield would see its fortress be captured by the enemy army.<br>Pabbata dashed forward, sword blazing, determined to pass through Cāṇakya’s defences and cut him down—Cāṇakya blocked, using the point of impact as a pivot to reposition himself to Pabbata’s side—his signature move, that Pabbata had been expecting, and he spun on his heel to face Cāṇakya again—Cāṇakya tried the same move again, and they circled each other.<br>Apparently surprised by the failure of his manoeuvre, Cāṇakya stumbled – and Pabbata’s eyes lit up, for this would be his first victory against Cāṇakya, the student would surpass the Professor – he took advantage of the confusion, and with the intention of attacking too quickly for Cāṇakya to react, swooped in for the kill. Cāṇakya quickly took a defensive stance, blocking Pabbata’s blows, allowing Pabbata to push the line of control with his sheer strength—<br>And when he realized it, it was too late; Cāṇakya had seized his fortress and taken it in his hands, holding it high and showing it off like a spoil of war. For in his mad passions and in the spirit of securing a victory against Cāṇakya for the first time, Pabbata had neglected the entire purpose of an army in a battle: to block the enemy’s movement into his own territory, and he had failed to recognize that he had been pushing the line of control into his own territory.<br>Humbled and embarrassed, Pabbata conceded.<br>Cāṇakya’s prideful smirk was barely noticeable; he did not take a sarcastic parting shot or make a heroic gesture as he often did after his victories in debate.<br>“That manoeuvre is possible in real battle,” he taught, “Only if the size of your cavalry and chariotry is much larger than your enemy’s, if the article you wish to lay siege to is sufficiently distant in its location from the site of the battlefield, and if it is poorly defended.”<br>“Or if you employ tactics of deception to compel the enemy fortress to surrender to you quickly, or to trap or harass the enemy’s pursuing army in its own country,” Candragupta said, considering.<br>It was an intelligent idea, Pabbata thought, but Cāṇakya’s expression was unrewarding as ever, and he only expressed his approval verbally.<br>(The disappeared Greek girl Thera had once asked Cāṇakya why he was so inexpressive in his manner, to which he had replied that there was a beautiful technology created by man eons ago for expression, and it was known as language. To obsess over the interpretation of inferior modes of communication, to promote art as a means of expression while language still lived, was a betrayal of the very spirit of man, and was analogous to having intercourse with a cheap prostitute when one’s righteously-wedded wife still lived.)<br>“That concludes the lesson for today,” Cāṇakya said. “But Pabbata, there is a matter of crucial importance that we must discuss.”<br>sports<br><br><br>
My teacher says that of a sportive king and a sportive country, a sportive country is always ruinous to the results of work, whereas a sportive king is beneficial to artisans, carpenters, musicians, buffoons and traders.
No, says Kautilya, a sportive country, taking to sports for relaxation from labour, causes only a trifling loss; and after enjoyment, it resumes work, whereas a sportive king causes oppression by showing indulgence to his courtiers, by seizing and begging, and by obstructing work in the manufactories.

<br>1.1_catapult<br><br>[date:-492|flashback,x]<br>“ … the next suitor for the hand in marriage of the unblemished princess Vapuṣmatī, whose radiant beauty knows no equal in history or in fiction, who was seized from the city of Champa upon the vanquishment of its rulers by the Great King Bimbisāra, the mightiest of the Magadhas, and indeed of all Kṣatriyas – is the fourth prince of Great King Bimbisāra, born of his queen Vajirakumari Chellana: Prince Ajātaśatru!”<br>Light ceremonial applause filled the arena, sounds of some vague positive chants – and Ajātaśatru strode in followed by what looked like a wheeled palanquin, pulled by two muscled attendants, and a cart containing several large rocks, pulled by four more attendants.<br>“I object to your faint appraisal of me,” said the prince, his eyes most serious and considering, “But it is no matter of importance. You have viewed some impressive feats of strength from my brothers and cousins – Kṣatravṛddha, who sliced through a Fir trunk in one blow as if its wood were softer than butter. Remarkable!”<br>He sent a flying kiss in the direction of his eldest brother, as if to clarify that all his words of praise were ironic. The crowd and courtiers shuffled uncomfortably, and Ajātaśatru’s own parents looked merely annoyed with his antics.<br>“But,” he continued, “I will show you something of far greater splendor, far greater beauty, far greater significance than any of the feats demonstrated by my brothers.”<br>Ajātaśatru’s attendant unveiled the most unusual device, that to the inquisitive faces in the audience appeared to be nothing more than a large spoon attached to some odd box-shaped contraption.<br>“Behold!” cried the prince, “The device of my own invention, the ejector of large stones, the Catapult!<br>“Kṣemravṛddhi says he can shatter a large boulder into fragments with four swings of his mace. How impressive! My device can turn an entire city wall to flour in the matter of minutes – wood and stone alike are defenceless against the might of my mind that I have materialized in this magnificent device.”<br>As a demonstration, his attendants slowly turned the catapult to its side to face an empty segment of the otherwise packed arena (for grand presentations of might always seemed to receive a large attendance in Magadha), loaded a stone from the cart into its magazine – and very ceremoniously, Ajātaśatru struck the device somewhere with a rod.<br>The steps of the arena chipped, and large cracks formed at the site of impact, and the women in the audience instinctively pressed their hands to their ears at the horrid crash that echoed through the bounds of the arena – Ajātaśatru fired again, and a large chunk broke off – and again, before King Bimbisāra finally beseeched him to end the demonstration, for the sake of the finances of rebuilding the arena if nothing else.<br>Ajātaśatru bowed to his father in thick irony. “I believe that should suffice as a demonstration of my might as well as of my many other qualities – that it should suffice to make your decision not only as to the groom for the maiden you would have taken for yourself if not for the jealousy of my mother and stepmothers—”<br>The king was furious, as were his queens and other princes.<br>“—but also as to your future heir, the future Lord of Magadha, who will bring this kingdom to heights not previously—”<br>“That is sufficient, son,” King Bimbisāra interrupted curtly. “This is a contest to find the man worthy of the war spoils that I have decided to donate out of the generosity of my heart, not of the throne of Magadha. But that is irrelevant: for you will be receiving neither.”<br>strength<br><br><br>
Strength is of three kinds: power of deliberation is intellectual strength; the possession of a prosperous treasury and a strong army is the strength of sovereignty; and martial power is physical strength.

<br>Pabbata quite enjoyed these sparring sessions, independent of any lesson there – for even as Cāṇakya was his Professor, and Candragupta his servant, it felt good to be able to just bond, free from the binds of such hierarchies, merely as thirteen-year old boys did.<br>“There is a task I require from you, Pabbata,” said Cāṇakya, straightening the green lining on his dhoti as they prepared for sleep. “It is no trivial task, and is one that may impose a significant cost to you. You may not ask me for my causes or motives for seeking this from you. Do you understand?”<br>Pabbata frowned. “What is the task?”<br>“It is good to ask that question before agreeing to perform an unstated favour,” said Cāṇakya approvingly. “But you should understand the confidentiality of this entire endeavour, and you may not repeat my words to anybody even if you refuse to obey my command. To do so would be a great breach of our trust and would sabotage our friendship and all that you have to gain from it in future. The same applies to Candragupta. Do I have your word?”<br>Pabbata nodded. Candragupta followed him.<br>“Listen to my words precisely as I speak them,” Cāṇakya commanded, and looked Pabbata dead in the eye. “And do not distort them in your mind, just as you would not distort a word of the triple Vedas.”<br>He nodded again.<br>“You must convince your father to start preparations for a military expedition to Indraprastha.”<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>What.<br>What, Cāṇakya?<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>What even.<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>Pabbata considered his response.<br>“Nothing would please me more than an expansion of Magadha’s borders, Professor,” he said at last, “And neither do I doubt your capacity to ensure my success in the achievement of this objective, even though all my father’s previous efforts to this end have been fruitless. But I must still object to this goal in itself: surely, the Ārjunāyanas, who rule Indraprastha, might be precisely the sort of allies I will need in my war, depending on the method of war that you will decide will be most appropriate when that time arrives. Surely, they are not a power I would seek to alienate – or much less, destroy, resulting only in the addition of territory to a kingdom ruled by my brother!”<br>Pabbata felt his voice rising with each word he said, and by the end of his sentence, it had truly become his belief on the matter.<br>Cāṇakya shook his head firmly. “The art of winning a civil war – or indeed in acquiring the power created by a war – does not lie merely in supporting one faction over another. It lies in providing covert support to both factions, through different identities or middle-men, and then committing to a side once the outcome of the war becomes clear. For a war whose outcome is known to both sides in advance should never be fought, any civil war that poses a serious threat to the reigning power will necessarily be uncertain in its outcome, and thus as one must not bet all of one’s wealth on one outcome in an uncertain horse race, one must not bet one’s entire political career on one outcome in a civil war.”<br>“I see … ” said Pabbata slowly. “So you wish to create dissension within Magadha by means of this war, so that I have two forces at my disposal, rather than one, and that I come out on top regardless of who wins.”<br>Pabbata had often assumed that Cāṇakya knew nothing about manipulating people, or about lying effectively – but it was frightening how close Cāṇakya’s plan for him was to his private plans with Cāṇakya, and he wondered if the whole character of a naïve genius was merely the image that Cāṇakya chose to present of himself.<br>He reminded himself to be a bit extra-wary of Cāṇakya when it came to his own plots.<br>“But,” Candragupta interrupted, his eyes narrowed. “You said we couldn’t ask you the cause for the favour, and yet you just explained it to us so thoroughly. Is your explanation a lie, then?”<br>Pabbata felt a pang of anger rise within him – if Candragupta was right, and Cāṇakya was lying to him, then that would be a betrayal, and he would have his revenge, Brahmahatya or no—<br>Cāṇakya turned around sharply, and cast an indignant look towards Candragupta. “Indeed. That is only a small part of the cause for this plot, and it is part of a much greater scheme of mine. I cannot reveal this scheme to you, and you will not be able to understand my motives on your own; all I can say is that it serves your interests, Pabbata, and you will have to place your complete trust in me if our friendship is to produce anything of value. All will become clear in time.”<br>They were quiet for a moment.<br>“Very well,” said Pabbata. “But I must press: you said that I could play both sides in this war. How would I obtain the support of the Ārjunāyanas if I am actively supporting my father’s campaign against them? What identity could I assume, and how can I be present in both Pāṭaliputra and Indraprastha simultaneously?”<br>“You will be present there through me—”<br>“No way,” Pabbata muttered. Cāṇakya ignored him and continued.<br>“—the king of the Ārjunāyanas has attended many debates that I have participated in, he is, as is everyone else, greatly impressed by me; he is a close acquaintance of mine. I will advise the Ārjunāyanas of Indraprastha in their war, just as you command the Magadhi army. And thus, the two of us, you and I, Pabbata, shall write history in whatever manner we find fit, we shall—”<br>“Unacceptable,” Pabbata repeated. He remembered his earlier oath to be wary of Cāṇakya’s plans, and shook his head vehemently. This reeked of manipulation, and he certainly did not intend to be written into history as the idiot puppet of Cāṇakya the great visionary, a cautionary tale for young princes against naivety.<br>“Forgive me, Professor, but while I honour you greatly and have nothing but respect for your intellect, I also fear it, and you cannot expect me to trust you so. You might simply install me as a pawn in Magadha to sabotage my army as per your bidding while you vanquish my people with the Ārjunāyana army.”<br>Cāṇakya was quiet for a while.<br>“It pains me that you distrust me so, Pabbata,” he sighed. “Have I truly given you a cause to be so suspicious of me?”<br>“No, but you also have not given me a cause to not be so suspicious of you. I am no fool, Professor – I know that you have an agenda of your own, goals of your own, and these may not be the same as mine in every manner. It is a great degree of trust you demand from me, and I cannot promise this to you yet.”<br>“Victory depends on trust between entire armies, entire countries of people. To establish such trust is difficult, but we could achieve great things much more easily if you simply just trusted me without cause. You must find allies whom you can trust, if you wish to succeed in war.”<br>Then Pabbata had an idea. He remembered the intelligence, the potential that Candragupta had showed over these years that they had spent at Takṣaśilā; the loyalty he had demonstrated that very day in pointing out – out of concern for Pabbata’s interests – the contradiction in Cāṇakya’s narrative and said:<br>“There is one other person, apart from myself, whom I trust, for he has been by my side since infancy, attending to every want of mine since the age that he became capable of doing so. Him I trust. If you are truly desirous of my interests, then you will allow Candragupta to take your place as the advisor of the Ārjunāyanas.”<br>Cāṇakya and Pabbata had an unspoken stare-off.<br>“And you believe,” Cāṇakya asked at last, “That I would not be able to turn Candragupta, in your absence?”<br>“Impossible,” said Pabbata, and Candragupta smiled gratefully.<br>“Very well, then,” Cāṇakya conceded, “Candragupta shall be appointed as advisor to the Ārjunāyanas, on my recommendation. All my influence over the Ārjunāyanas will be through him, and he will covertly keep you updated of every detail of our conversation via the cipher that I have taught you. It need not be said that you will not share this cipher with anybody, and shall discard his messages as soon as you receive them in Pāṭaliputra.<br>“And,” he continued, turning to Candragupta in a very Professorial gait, “I believe it may be beneficial for you to maintain some degree of opacity in your affairs at Indraprastha – but it will also not do to have the Ārjunāyanas believe that you have deceived them. Thus, you shall adopt a synonymous alias: Śaśigupta.”<br>slavery<br><br><br>
It is no crime for barbarians to sell or mortgage the life of their own offspring. But never shall an Ārya be subjected to slavery.

<br>1.2_rebels<br><br>[date:-492|flashback,x]<br>“Kṣatravṛddha can slice a tree in one blow, how impressive!” Ajātaśatru’s voice dripped with indignance. “Do you know what else can uproot a tree in one blow? An elephant! Do you know what an elephant cannot do? This!”<br>He struck his contraption again, sending a rock hurling past the palatial walls and crashing somewhere out of vision with a noise that was still deafening.<br>“Truly, I do not comprehend what you believe your great feat is, son,” said King Bimbisāra. “You merely struck a latch. It is your assistants who are doing the heavy work.”<br>Ajātaśatru stumbled, astonished by his own father’s stupidity.<br>“Does the strength of my intellect mean nothing to you, father?” he pleaded.<br>It was Bimbisāra’s most trusted advisor, an Ājīvaka monk by the name of Varṣākāra, that answered.<br>“If it is your scholarship that you wish to be respected for, young prince,” he suggested, his voice soft, “Perhaps you ought to seek refuge in one of the Western realms, like Vaiśālī, Kāśī, Ayodhya, Mathura, even Takṣaśilā—”<br>“Ah yes!” cried Ajātaśatru. “The Vedic lands! Where the Brāhmaṇas, who brag about their incredible scholarship, believe that archery is really about building bridges out of arrows, that the hallmark of a great archer is the ability to shoot an arrow at the sky and make it rain! Yes, perhaps THERE I will be respected for my strategic acumen and my ingenuity at creating military technologies.”<br>“I studied at Takṣaśilā,” Varṣākāra tried to argue. “And even as I have many differences with the ways of the Brāhmaṇas, you are being unfair in your assessment of them, as you are in your critique of your own people.”<br>“Or perhaps you are a clown who does not comprehend my genius,” Ajātaśatru spat at the ground.<br>“Perhaps,” Varṣākāra admitted. “Perhaps you are ahead of your time.”<br>This seemed to invoke a new fervour in Ajātaśatru, who threw the key of his catapult towards the ground and unsheathed his sword.<br>“History is littered with the corpses of forgotten men who were ahead of their time,” he muttered, his face red.<br>Ajātaśatru then strode towards the pedestal upon which Princess Vapuṣmatī was tied, slashed through her chains with his sword, and kissed her lips with cutting rage.<br>The crowd gasped; the king, the queens and princes, the army and all were completely thrown off, if they hadn’t been already, finding themselves in a rather unusual situation and not having a faintest instinct for how to react; the other princes unsheathed their swords, and Vapuṣmatī was shaking, terrified, by the civil war that was unfurling around her between the Magadhi princes.<br>Ajātaśatru spoke loud and clear: “Allow me to defile the sanctity of this entire ceremony by saying the following words: the woman you believe is now your wife, my dear brother, has already been enjoyed by me! Not only this, Kṣatravṛddha: the evening prior to this contest, she cried into my arms, proclaiming her undying affection for me, telling me that she would forever hold me to be her Lord, regardless of Father’s unwise judgement in today’s contest.”<br>Vapuṣmatī was sobbing.<br>The noble family and everyone else was at a loss for words.<br>Kṣatravṛddha charged with a guttural cry of fury, brandishing his sword.<br>It was not clear if he meant to attack Ajātaśatru or the princess, but Ajātaśatru certainly made no effort to defend her.<br>“Kṣatravṛddha!” cried Queen Kosala Devi at her son, breaking out of her stupor, and the said prince stopped in his tracks, fuming in indignance.<br>“But if despite all your pretenses, brother,” Ajātaśatru continued, striking his own sword against the ground, heedless to the hurt that his words caused to the woman who hailed him as her savior, “You are yet willing to marry a woman defiled by me, then I shall myself throw her at your feet. Truly, I care very little for her myself, and only took her to spite you, the favourite son of our idiot father.”<br>“Ajātaśatru!” cried Queen Chellana, deciding to put an end to her own son’s tirade. “If what you say is true, you have committed a grave crime against the chastity of this maiden, against the honour of your brother, against the honour of our tribe—”<br>“YOU speak to me of honour and chastity?” snapped Ajātaśatru. “YOU, mother? You were a princess of Vaiśālī, and yet you married a barbarian man whom you despised in order to secure his favour towards your kingdom. There is a word we have, for women who sell their bodies in exchange for favours!”<br>Bimbisāra’s eyes were colder than the iciest peaks of the Himalayas. Queen Chellana rose, shocked beyond words to so much as chastise her son—<br>“And was it not a grave crime against the chastity of this maiden to murder her family before her eyes?” Ajātaśatru continued, a perverted grimace on his face, “To chain her and parade her through the streets of Rajagriha, to announce to every beggar and criminal of this country that he too may have an opportunity to make her his sex slave if he can chop down a tree in one hit?”<br>“Enough!” cried King Bimbisāra.<br>But Ajātaśatru continued.<br>“Do you know how I would chop down a tree, father?”<br>He held out his left hand, and one of his attendants scrambled over, bowing before him and bestowing him with a bag of jingling coins. Ajātaśatru then strode towards Kṣatravṛddha, unbothered by the unsheathed sword in eldest prince’s hands, and tossed the coins in his brother’s face, letting them scatter onto the ground.<br>Ignoring his brother’s indignant cries, Ajātaśatru hollered across the arena:<br>“I would pay my brother – or one of the thousands of other young fools in this kingdom whose strength equals or exceeds his – the small sum of money that he is worth, and take him as my slave. Indeed, much as you purchased your wives, father!”<br>“Enough,” King Bimbisāra said again, his voice more authoritative than before. “I have allowed this insanity to progress for far too long. This is a svayaṃvara, not an auction, and Princess Vapuṣmatī is a bride, not a sex slave.”<br>Ajātaśatru folded his hands and gave an exaggerated bow, preparing to leave.<br>Not one person said a word – not the king, not the minister, not the queens, not the princes, and certainly not any of the attendees. The only human sounds that could be heard – if it was even regarded as that – were the sniffles of Princess Vapuṣmatī, who knew not of what would be done with her.<br>They were too thrown off by the bizarreness of his rant and of his antics, and for the most part were just grateful to have him go.<br>Ajātaśatru picked up the key that he had earlier tossed to the ground in rage—<br>—and struck the device with one mighty blow, launching a boulder straight at the balcony that housed the royal attendees—<br>—the balcony separated from the rest of the palace—<br>—and crashed into the ground, inclusive of its inhabitants and of the shards of the stone that had shattered against it.<br>The crowd screamed, too shocked to begin to even process the far-reaching consequences of what had just occurred before their very eyes, to even process whether they ought to flee for their own lives. The imperial guard started yelling contradictory orders, and some rushed towards the site of the collapse.<br>A growl sounded, and King Bimbisāra’s arm rose from underneath the rubble, pulling himself out.<br>His booming voice came out like his body, bloody and broken:<br>“Capture the traitor!”<br>Some of the Imperial Guard had surrounded Ajātaśatru, but they were too frightened, and too out of protocol to know what to do.<br>“As you command, Great King,” said a squadron of the Imperial Guards to Bimbisāra, and arrested him.<br>virginity<br><br><br>

<br>Candragupta silently marvelled at Professor Cāṇakya’s skilful manipulation of Pabbata into doing his bidding – so cunning had been his line of questioning and negotiation that the prince apparently felt that he himself had proposed the idea, that it was a settlement favourable to himself, rather than having been the precise exercise of Cāṇakya’s will.<br>He himself was only able to tell that this was his Professor’s intention, because he knew that Cāṇakya had been courting him for some time, and that he possessed an intention to bestow upon Candragupta similar favours and glory as he had promised the prince. Cāṇakya had praised various kingly qualities that were found in him but not in Pabbata, and even made an effort to inculcate those qualities that were missing in Candragupta. His manner of discipline with Candragupta was stricter than with Pabbata, and while Pabbata interpreted this as a sign of respect for himself as a prince, it was clear to Candragupta that Cāṇakya regarded such discipline as of special necessity to his training.<br>Yet the Professor had been sufficiently vague in his private conversations with Candragupta, adopting the stance of a double-crosser, so as to maintain plausible deniability were his treachery to be reported to the prince by Candragupta, and to make such a report sound too absurd and frivolous to be entertained. And in Pabbata’s presence, the Professor was always furtive with his words to Candragupta, maintaining a certain dual meaning so that the prince could only find offense to his statements by admitting to the flaws of his own character, which he was too conceited to do. The Professor had often spoken of the strategy of doing and receiving favours from an enemy to gain their trust and gather power in this way – Candragupta had to observe that this was what he had himself unintentionally achieved with Pabbata; the prince trusted his loyalty so fully that he was blind to the risks of this trust in his own plans, that the thought of this trust being false was so painful he refused to so much as consider it.<br>Candragupta himself was unsure what his own intentions would be.<br>He was certain that he was a loyal companion to Pabbata, yet it was likely this very quality that caused Professor Cāṇakya to seek him out and attempt to train him. In his actions so far, he had only sought to gain an education from Professor Cāṇakya, and to honour him as was expected from a student, and to do Pabbata’s bidding when it was required of him. Yet he did not know what he might do if these duties came to conflict, and he suspected that this dilemma might soon be more than hypothetical.<br>scheme_1<br><br><br>
The conqueror may dismiss a confidential chief of a corporation. The chief may go over to the enemy as a friend and offer to supply him with recruits and other help collected from the conqueror's territory or followed by a band of spies — and please the enemy by destroying a disloyal village or a regiment or an ally of the conqueror — and by sending as a present the elephants, horses, and disaffected persons of the conqueror's army or of the latter's ally (…)
And when he has gained their confidence, he may send them down to the conqueror to be routed down on the occasion of a farcical attempt to capture elephants or wild tribes.

Some princes were slain, others escaped taking heavy casualties to their own guards and demoralized the faction still loyal to Bimbisāra, and Ajātaśatru immediately ordered the execution of that faction.<br>Several of his closest allies rushed towards him and created a platform to raise him on their shields.

 <br><br>avarna<br><br>Hear, hear!<br>Hear, Kambojas! Hear, residents of the town of Avarana!<br>Our country is said to be the most beautiful of all countries in the world, its men are said to be the most noble and its women to be the most beautiful in all three worlds, and both are the most skilled in their respective arts and such pursuits – this is held by the Indians and Iranians alike, that we are the most exemplary of Āryas.<br>Yet they continue to treat our country as a commercial article for their enjoyment, as subject to their rule, not to be afforded any independence of our own.<br>Far too long has Takṣaśilā enjoyed a special autonomy under the Persians. As a result of this accord, the Gandhāras have grown closer to the Persians than they are to the Kambojas, their own brothers in blood!<br>Unacceptable! says the noble Prince Sanjaya of Takṣaśilā from whom this message is relayed to you.<br>Either the Gandhāras shall be placed under the same rule as the Kambojas are – or the Kambojas shall be elevated to the same status as the Gandhāras enjoy. No longer must the Kambojas tolerate this differential treatment from the Persians, this subjugation of our people to a distant king with whom we share few bonds.<br>Prince Sanjaya is intelligent and brave, he has the endorsement of many great scholars even as they are too afraid to pronounce their endorsement publicly. He is affected towards a Kamboja maiden, the apsara Sukeśī, and he has married her in the Gandharva style, for this he has been disowned by King Āmbhi, his father, and for this reason he has rebelled.<br>Your most blessed town has been selected by Prince Sanjaya as the location for a fort of his construction. He seeks your support in his secession from Takṣaśilā and promises you far better treatment than what you have been given by the Persians, he promises you a kingdom that has the strength to stand for interests, that is not merely at the mercy of the Persians.<br>To this end, he has already secured the support of the powerful King Puruṣottama of the Vṛṣṇis, the mightiest enemy of the Persians, and of the mighty Queen Kṛpā of the Matsyaka Scythians, whose tribe is known for having vanquished the Persians and beheaded the emperor Koorush many centuries prior. Each of these allies has been prophesied to be great conquerors and liberators, and they are the natural allies of a people of such dignity and stature as the Kambojas.<br>The residents of Avarana are directed to start building a great fort for Prince Sanjaya – directors will be dispatched to employ craftsmen, builders, guards, mercenaries and servants for this purpose. Those who co-operate with the prince will be rewarded handsomely for their efforts, both individually and via their service to a Kamboja victory – for Prince Sanjaya is not short on wealth nor on his capacity to acquire it from his enemies. And those who act as traitors to the cause of the Kambojas, who refuse to provide their labour for the Kamboja cause, will be regarded as such, and will be punished by the gods for their betrayal.<br>Rejoice, noble Kambojas! For today marks the beginning of a new era in the history of the Kambojas, an era in which we shall reclaim that glory which has been so wrongfully seized from us. Salute Prince Sanjaya, for he is the saviour that you have been awaiting, the hero of ancient prophecies.<br>

Or a spy may tell a self-confident son of the chief of mercenary corporations: "You are the son of such and such a king and are kept here under the apprehension of danger from enemies." When he is deluded with this belief, the conqueror may help him with men and money and set him against the mercenary corporations. When the object in view is realised, the conqueror may also banish him.

<br>ghrtaci<br><br>O Princess Ghṛtācī of the Matsyaka Scythians – whose beauty is equated by no other maiden of any race in any of the three worlds – whose auspicious birth was heralded by the great sages of the Āryas as prophetic of a great conqueror from Strīrājya and by the sages of the Western tribes as the reincarnation of the Great Queen Tahm-Rayish who vanquished the Persians.<br>This message is from an Ārya of Gandhāra who, remaining anonymous, has chosen to identify himself merely as “a well-wisher of yours”.<br>He says: Beware your friends, princess.<br>Beware of those who demand a right to your trust for they are of the same bloodline.<br>As the dynastic light of a most illustrious Scythian line, you have been taught by your family to beware your enemies – but I, who am neither your relation nor your enemy, tell you to beware of both.<br>It is foolish for you to celebrate the rise in ranks of your sister Kṛpā and the presence that she has made in Kamboja.<br>In truth, she is only seizing what is rightfully yours.<br>If this thought is too painful or offensive for you to hold, then take that as proof of my words, as proof that those you call your own have enslaved your mind even without enslaving you, that each of them use your abilities towards their ends without heed to those capacities of yours that serve your own ambitions.<br>You must prove me wrong, princess. You must prove to me, that you have not been enslaved so, as most boys and girls of our age so naively are.<br>The other Scythian tribes have pushed yours South of the Oxus River, and in your new home you are displaced by the Bāhlīkas who seek to reclaim the land that was once theirs. If your sister Kṛpā claims Kamboja for herself, then you may assume that she will take the whole of Āryāvarta for herself. You will have nowhere to go, nothing to rule, no legacy to claim.<br>You are the prophesied conqueror of all the countries East of the Sindhu river – do not allow your sister to take this title for herself. Your name is one that ought to be recited by the bards of history for as long as men’s tongues last – do not allow it to be forgotten. For prophecies are made true by your own actions, and the lazy do not have prophecies written about them.<br>Consider your options carefully and wisely, and seek out opportunities to avail, or make them yourself.<br>

(In Śākala) the women, drunk and naked, laugh and dance outdoors in the city; unadorned with garlands or unguents, they drunkenly sing various obscene songs that are as musical as a donkey’s bray or a camel’s bleat. They are without restraint in intercourse as in all other matters; in drunken madness they call each other various endearing epithets. Making drunk cries to their husbands, these fallen women give themselves up to dancing without observing restrictions even on sacred days.
What man would willingly dwell, even for a moment, among these fallen, depraved Bāhlīkas?
Crossing the Śatadru, returning to my own country, I await to cast my eyes again upon the beautiful women with thick frontal bones, with blazing stickers of red arsenic on their foreheads, with streaks of jet black collyrium on their eyes!

<br>It was in the evening that Cāṇakya released the pigeon that they had been carrying for so long.<br>“What is that, Professor?” asked Candragupta – no, Śaśigupta, as Cāṇakya had instructed him to completely play the part of his new identity.<br>Cāṇakya took a long time to answer, and when he did, he simply said: “A letter.”<br>Śaśigupta knew better than to press further.<br>They stared into the fire.<br>Deprived of Pabbata’s company, the thirteen-year-old boys had now become fully exposed to the harshness of the journey that so many merchants had built their entire lives around – they passed through the kingdom of Puruṣottama without stopping at any town, for he was the only king to claim enmity with Gandhāra – they rested instead at the city of Śākala in the Madra country, with all its infamous over-sexualized depravities – then rode through the tracts ruled by the mercenary corporations, the Trigartas and Yaudheyas, where the roads were damaged due to the constant warring – and yet once they had passed the Yaudheya city of Śrughna and the sacred Ārjunāyana city of Indraprastha and passed into Magadhi imperial territory, the condition of the Northern Highway worsened significantly, crumbling and muddy, without a single resting place (for such resting places would be defenseless against the robbers and wild tribes who had grown powerful due to Magadhi neglect – and often even imperial patronization to instill terror in its people) … and this was just on the segment of the highway before Mathura.<br>(Cāṇakya remarked, at one point, that the road was worse than the road he had taken to first arrive at Takṣaśilā in his childhood – but did not elaborate further, when asked, on where that road connected to.)<br>“When Pabbata was with us,” Śaśigupta remarked, “We never saw this all so darkly. We can no longer simply rely on the threat of Magadhi might for our protection.”<br>Cāṇakya smiled wryly. “Is that how you see your master, Śaśigupta? That his function is that of a mere bodyguard to you?”<br>Even as Śaśigupta was quite certain of what Cāṇakya’s intentions were, and he trusted his Professor quite entirely, to hear such an accusation, made even in jest, sent a jolt of terror through his body. He laughed weakly.<br>Silence ensued for some time longer.<br>“There is a question I must ask you,” said Cāṇakya. “What is the nature of your loyalty to Pabbata?”<br>Śaśigupta inhaled deeply with dread, having known for far too long that this question would eventually be asked of him – if not by his Professor, then by himself. And in truth, he did not even know if it was that he did not know the answer, or that his mind simply refused to entertain that mode of thinking.<br>“What is of primary concern to you?” Cāṇakya continued, “His interests, or his agency? That is to say, would you be willing to keep secrets from him, or to disobey his orders, should I judge that this were in the prince’s own interests?”<br>“I must ask what such situation you believe my arise,” Śaśigupta questioned. “That you believe Pabbata would act in a way that is contrary to his own interests, and that this will require an intervention on my part?”<br>Cāṇakya’s face was grim.<br>“There are many excellent qualities in Pabbata,” the boy admitted. “Qualities that make him fit to be king. And yet, I worry about his suspicious mind – that his suspicions of me may cause him to act rashly, or to forgo crucial opportunities because of the risk of betrayal. I can only hope that he will trust me at least when I make him king – for what more could I give him to win his trust?”<br>Cāṇakya’s words were manipulative – Śaśigupta recognized that much, for his Professor was not one to only hope for anything; he was the sort to make plans, or to alter made plans, to ensure that a desirable outcome occurred. He did not comment on that, however.<br>“I will say this much, Professor,” said Śaśigupta, “For whatever you demand of me, I shall assess the prospects, and my trust in you, independently of what Pabbata thinks. For if you believe that his mind is biased against you, then it falls upon me as his loyal companion to be the voice of reason to counter that bias.”<br>(But oh, did he sometimes wish things could simply be simple with Cāṇakya, for them to just act as friends of their age did.)<br>facial_signs<br><br><br>
By way of collecting his wandering thoughts into a resolve, the king exhibits in his appearance and movements his inclination, anger, pleasure, sorrow, determination, fear, and change in the pairs of opposite feelings. These are the signs of the king’s satisfaction with a courtier (and the reverse indicates displeasure):
"By cognising wisdom in others, he is pleased; he is attentive to others’ speech; he gives a seat; he allows himself to be met privately; he is not suspicious; he enjoys conversation; he spontaneously looks to things without reminder; he is tolerant of rational argument; he issues orders with a smile; he touches with the hand; he does not laugh at what is commendable; he commends the qualities of another behind him; he consults the courtier during meals, sports and when in trouble; increasingly honours the courtier and his followers and averts his troubles; shares secrets with him.”

<br>1.4_coronation<br><br>[date:-492|flashback,x]<br>The coronation speech of King Ajātaśatru.<br>(The king, drunk and dishevelled, stumbles onto the lectern, and drops a clay pot onto the floor behind him before resting his arms on the back of the throne. The crowd watches him intensely, slightly uncomfortable, slightly confused and slightly petrified. Gradually, he raises one hand into the air and lets out a bored cry.)<br>Ah, yes – thank you! Thank you … to who? Yes … to me! From all your wives! You impotent husbands of prostitutes.<br>No, that is not what I meant to say. But it is true. You know what else is true? Varṣākāra sings as he bathes! He says they are holy chants, but the Ājīvakas do not have holy chants, do they? And even if they did, I am sure he is just inclined towards music and being merry. You know who else was inclined towards music and being merry? My father! And he is dead now!<br>(The king laughs uncontrollably for a full half-minute. The crowd is frozen in shock, and Varṣākāra is trembling..)<br>I jest, I jest – he’s just in prison..<br>Oh yes … that reminds me … my father … I wanted to do something to him.<br>Kill him? No, not yet.<br>Torture him? I’m already doing that.<br>Thank him! Ah yes … that’s what I wanted to say.<br>Thank you, Father, O mighty King Bimbisāra, the former Lord of the Magadhas – for if not for your seed I would not exist. But then again, neither would my idiot brothers, so is that truly so bad? Yes it is, I am simply that important. No, that’s not why I wanted to thank him. But I must say I do not resemble my father in the slightest. Is there something I must know, Mother? Was there a more intelligent, less lazy Vaiśālī man than my father? I mean, yes, all of them, but I am not certain when you would have had the time to commit such an atrocity—<br>(The king makes an obscene gesture.)<br>—however justifiable it may be, to circumcise my father so. From what I know, he did nothing but laze and frolick with his wives like a depraved dog until I urged him to invade Anga.<br>Yes! That is what I wanted to thank him for. For conquering Anga! Even though it was I who did so, truly. Forgive me, Vapuṣmatī, my queen – I did not wish to slay your family so, I did not wish you to be treated in the manner you were – although I did wish to treat you in such manner. Which I did.<br>(The king laughs. The queen makes a shy gesture to protect the image of her chastity. A courtier laughs along with the king, and is beheaded on the spot.)<br>Yes, thank you, father!–Can you hear me from your prison?– for crushing all those petty rebellions. For conquering all those petty tribes. So I can focus on the real task at hand: the conquest of all Āryāvarta!<br>omniscience<br><br><br>
Proclamation of his omniscience is as follows: rejection of his chief officers when their secret domestic and other private affairs are known; revealing the names of traitors after receiving information from spies specially employed to find out such men; pointing out the impolitic aspect of any course of action suggested to him; and pretensions to the knowledge of foreign affairs by means of his power to read omens and signs invisible to others when information about foreign affairs is just received through a domestic pigeon which has brought a sealed letter.

<br>arjunayana<br><br>A speech, from Śaśigupta of Takṣaśilā to the Ārjunāyanas of Indraprastha.<br>I salute you, Vṛṣṇiman, the chief of the mighty Ārjunāyanas, the worthy claimants to the legacy of the mighty Arjuna, of the Kuru line of antiquity – the blessed of the defenders of the Kṣatriya Dharma, who are honoured for their quality that a Brāhmaṇa need not tell them twice for them to understand the truth and execute the correct action. I compliment the beauty and grandeur of your delusive chamber, the oldest of its form known in the three worlds.<br>Professor Cāṇakya has received an intimation of a military expedition against the Ārjunāyanas. He has forbidden me from disclosing to you the nature of this expedition, or its belligerents, for we must consider every possibility of betrayal – but I will say that the threat will be more serious than anything the Ārjunāyanas have ever faced in the past, and that I frankly regard it as unlikely you will be able to survive the attack without my intervention.<br>I ask that you allow me to advise you alongside your strategist Nripanjaya – I cannot leave the entire task up to you, as my informants in the enemy’s territory trust only myself and Professor Cāṇakya, who is busy in Takṣaśilā with his other students, but I do not demand any power or direct control over your armies; I ask only that you accept the information I provide you and act as per my advice.<br>I will not demand any salary from you beyond the provision for my sustenance, for I am a student of Professor Cāṇakya, and am here on his behest – he will only request his reward after the war is over, the fruits of his help are realized to you, and you have rebuilt any damages that your country suffers in the course of the war. This should relieve you of any apprehensions, for we have little to gain from deceiving you; from this alliance we desire nothing more than your trust and the defeat of our common enemy.<br>1.5_birth<br><br>[date:-492|flashback,x]<br>As the barbarians of Rajagriha listened to the deranged cries of their newly-coronated king and the horrendous cries of his political opponents as they were crushed by elephants on public streets, that very moonless night on the opposite corner of Āryāvarta, the people of Mathura celebrated the birth of their most prosperous merchant’s first-born child.<br>That youngling was named Vāsudeva.]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/2/2.2.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/2/2.2.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 14:27:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[2.3]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>[date:-332|magadha,x]<br>“One final thing, prince,” said Devajit, still bowed before Pabbata in salute, “Our spies have been on the lookout for Cāṇakya as you directed, and I believe there is cause for you to worry about his loyalty to you.”<br>“Do tell,” Pabbata replied neutrally.<br>“Cāṇakya seems to have disappeared – he is neither in Takṣaśilā, nor among the Ārjunāyanas. I thus surveyed all reports of unusual people and activities from our territorial border and asked around using his physical description, and learned of a young boy with a black horse and a concealed face who is scouring around the Śūrasena country postulating odd questions about the Order of Saṃkarṣaṇa and the _Seal of the Peacock.”<br>Pabbata inhaled sharply.<br>The Order of Saṃkarṣaṇa had been vanquished by Emperor Mahāpadma, its members executed and its forts reduced to flour – ending one hundred and fifty years of expensive war. The Seal of the Peacock had been their emblem, the banner of resistance against Magadhi imperialism. And despite the brutal manner in which Magadha had suppressed any potential future rebellions in Mathura, widespread rumour remained of an underground continued operation of the Order.<br>“This is his own emblem that he has shown to our disguised spies:—”<br>Devajit produced a clay tablet with an engraved sign on it – a +, with two arms on its top-left and one on its top-right.<br>“—do you recognize what this is, prince?”<br>Pabbata shook his head, although he recognized the Brahmi character.<br>The incredible thing, Pabbata realized, was that Cāṇakya would have a perfectly innocuous explanation for his antics – just as he had contacted the Ārjunāyanas to produce a conflict in Magadha, a wave that Pabbata could ride to power, this could also be his intention with courting the Order of Saṃkarṣaṇa. Of course, there were other factions within the Magadhi mainstream that he could take the support of instead, but Cāṇakya would probably argue that a larger number of players made it easier for an intelligent strategist to sow chaos, or that he had even greater goals for Pabbata than what could be achieved from within Magadha.<br>The problem was that depending on Cāṇakya in this way required a great deal of trust from Pabbata – as Cāṇakya had already confessed. Much easier to just impress his father by betraying Cāṇakya.<br>friends<br><br><br>
When, after having put down the enemy, and after having grown in power, a friend becomes unsubmissive, the conqueror should cause the friend to incur the displeasure of a neighbour and of the king who is next to the neighbour.
Or the conqueror may employ a scion of the friend's family or an imprisoned prince to seize his lands; or the conqueror may so act that his friend, desirous of further help, may continue to be obedient.
The conqueror should never help his friend when the latter is deteriorating worse and worse; a politician should so keep his friend that the latter neither deteriorates nor grows in power.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 7.18:32-24
<br>godliness_2<br><br><br>
Astrologers, sooth-sayers, horologists, story-tellers and sign-readers, together with spies and their disciples, inclusive of those who have witnessed the wonderful performances of the conqueror should give wide publicity to the power of the king to associate with gods throughout his territory. Likewise in foreign countries, they should spread the news of gods appearing before the conqueror and of his having received from heaven weapons and treasure. Those who are well versed in horary and astrology and the science of omens should proclaim abroad that the conqueror is a successful expert in explaining the indications of dreams and in understanding the language of beasts and birds. They should not only attribute the contrary to his enemy, but also show to the enemy's people the shower of firebrand with the noise of divine drums on the day of the birth-star of the enemy.

<br>magadha_persia_aftermath<br><br>The messenger rose from his prostrated state, keeping his posture formal.<br>“There are several pieces of grave news, O Great King of Kings,” said Haxamanish solemnly, his head bowed and his body trembling. He looked toward the courtiers helplessly, seeking their advice – the most aged of them, the Emperor’s most trusted advisor Ariyawratha, gave him a subtle encouraging nod, as if instructing him to proceed with the news without excessive formality.<br>“Firstly – our most prosperous province, Gandhāra, has been invaded by the Matsyaka Queen Kṛpā, who has secured the Western parts of the province. King Āmbhi remains is loyal to us, but his court is fragmented, with his own son joining the rebels, and he is forced to invest his resources against the advances of his Eastern rivals in Hind, who, as you are aware, had rebelled again from us several years prior, with the support of the Yaudheyas, depriving us of a third of our government revenues.<br>The court was silent – not because they were fearful, or because they had no questions to raise, but because they did not know what to feel, or what to think without explicit instruction from their God-king. But the God-king Darayavaush himself remained stoic, finding himself in a more complicated situation than he had ever known.<br>It was Ariyawratha who spoke.<br>“And how have they contracted the Yaudheyas, messenger? Surely they lack the funds to do so.”<br>Haxamanish was shivering.<br>“I believe … I believe, O Great King of Kings, and do forgive me for raising such an inauspicious possibility … I believe that security of the Imperial tax collection in Hind has been breached.”<br>Darayavaush slammed his fist down in rage.<br>“Do they believe that the Empire has no funds of its own beyond an annual collection from Hind? That we are entirely reliant on a mere two provinces for our entire administration, that we will allow such a prosperous country to secede from the empire without consequence?”<br>But his words were vacuous – for all in the court knew that Hind alone contributed a third of Imperial revenue, and the treasury had not saved as much from previous years as it ought to responsibly have. If Hind rebelled, and Gandhāra’s position was seen as weak by the other Indian states, it was almost certain that the remaining states of the Punjab would pledge their support to Hind – or make a show of surrender to them.<br>“What is the cause of these events?” asked Ariyawratha “What is that factor that has undergone such change in the East, that it appears the Empire is left with no allies in the region?”<br>“Ally or no ally,” the Emperor growled, “We shall crush these rebellions and punish the traitors and all those who supported them, even if it bankrupts the treasury. I shall not be known as the Emperor who lost India.”<br>“It appears—,” started Haxamanish, “There are rumours— there are reliable reports, that the Eastern Empire … ” he controlled his stammering, “The Eastern Empire is expanding its boundaries once again. It appears that they are preparing for a Westward expedition soon – and is likely that they are sowing dissension in our Eastern provinces either with intent to conquer them, or to secure their independence from the Empire so they can be used as buffer states against us.”<br>Darayavaush let out a low growl. “So these rebels believe that the Easterners will come to their assistance?”<br>The messenger nodded. “The Easterners have set their sights on the city of Indraprastha – a site that is sacred to all Indians. If they conquer Indraprastha, they will truly be unstoppable, or so it is believed. But that is not all.”<br>“What could be worse than all that we have just heard?” Ariyawratha muttered dejectedly, but no one heard him. Even as he had only seen in all his life a Persia undefeated in battle, he was still possessed of sufficient age and sense to see the signs.<br>“The third piece of news,” Haxamanish stammered – his voice had become barely intelligible at this point, “O Great King of Kings … The rebellion is not only in the East – if rumour is correct … the king of the Greeks, Alexander, is planning an invasion of Persia. I fear to say this, Emperor – but such are the words used by your enemies in this very court: they say that the end times are near!— that the Frashokereti approaches!”<br>The messenger’s bloodied head rolled down the carpet.<br>all_three<br><br><br>
He may enjoy in an equal degree the three pursuits of life: virtue, wealth, and desire, which are inter-dependent upon each other. Any one of these three, when enjoyed to an excess, hurts not only the other two, but also itself.

<br>2.1_childhood<br><br>[date:-481|flashback,x]<br>The eleven-year-old Ekanamsha looked up at her mother with bubbly eyes. “Mother,” she asked, pausing her knitting for a half-minute. “How did you and Father marry?”<br>Her twin brother Vāsudeva let out an exaggerated yawn from behind the cotton-paper manuscripts that he was scouring over, earning a disapproving look from Mother Devaki.<br>“Your father won my hand in marriage at my svayaṃvara,” Devaki explained, reminiscing with a smile, “He had to defeat my many suitors, many of whom were princes and nobles – to prove to my father and I that he was most worthy of me, and that there was nothing more he desired in the world than me.”<br>“You can’t prove a falsehood,” remarked Vāsudeva with snarky amusement.<br>“VA̅SUDEVA!” his mother objected.<br>Vāsudeva put down his book. “Forgive me, mother, I did not mean to belittle the affection between you and Father. But there was NOTHING more he desired? REALLY? If there was NOTHING more he desired, why did he not just poison all your other suitors?”<br>“VA̅SUDEVA!” Devaki cried again, but Father (Vasudeva) was guffawing.<br>“What? There are many poisons that would go undetected in an autopsy.”<br>“But would it not be suspicious if all the other suitors mysteriously died the day before the svayaṃvara?” Ekanamsha asked innocently.<br>Devaki started: “Ekanamsha that is NOT the reason, that is NOT the point I am trying—”<br>“Then he could have just poisoned those suitors who were sufficiently skilful to have a decent chance of defeating him. And perhaps undersell his own abilities prior to the date so as to not make it seem that all those who were stronger than him were dead. By the way, Father, what is the meaning of this word?”<br>As Vasudeva peered into Vāsudeva’s book and explained the function of the mentioned surgical instrument, Devaki looked very cross at her son’s line of questioning.<br>“Vāsudeva … ” she said tiredly, “This is the sort of thing for which we are sending you to Sage Saṃkarṣaṇa’s gurukula.”<br>“YOU ARE SENDING ME AWAY? You will send your only child away?” (Ekanamsha glared at him)<br>“Sage Saṃkarṣaṇa is a foremost expert on ethics and virtue,” Vasudeva explained supportively. “For all your brilliance, my son, I believe that you are in necessity of an education on these matters.”<br>“No! I do not believe you SHOULD have poisoned your other suitors – I’m merely saying that the fact that you didn’t, shows that there are other values you hold more sacred than Mother, like non-killing! I am not denying morals, I am pointing out the immoral present in MOTHER’S words, I’m EXPLAINING ethics! Sage Saṃkarṣaṇa needn’t teach me, I MYSELF am an expert on ethics!”<br>“Vāsudeva, you are being far too arrogant–”<br>“I do not need instruction to understand why poisoning your competitors is wrong! You didn’t need instruction to understand that – everyone understands that! Well, I suppose a barbarian might not, but a barbarian will also not be knowledgeable about the different types of poisons that may be used.”<br>“An intelligent barbarian,” Ekanamsha mused. “Where have we ever seen one of those?”<br>“Are you referring to the wicked new King of Magadha?” Vāsudeva questioned.<br>“No, brother, I’m referring to YOU!”<br>irredeemable<br><br><br>

<br>“Speak!” ordered the turban-clad man, his eyes bloodshot and filled with suspicion.<br>The boy had surrendered himself before him, but he still suspected a plot and had sent men to scout the camp’s surroundings to look for an ambush. The camp, located several journeys away from the capital city of Mathura in a well-disguised forested spot at the intersection of two streams, was by no means easy to find, nor was it a location that one might too often reach by chance.<br>Shockingly, the captive’s voice was steady, unaffected apparently by the sword that had been placed at his throat and the archers that had been readied on him.<br>“What do you wish to know first? And keep in mind that as I came to you voluntarily, anything you wish to know is also something I wish to be known by you.”<br>Achyuta took a moment to consider this.<br>“How did you learn of our location?” he asked finally.<br>The boy did not make any attempt to loosen the scarf that he had wrapped around his face. His eyes were all that were visible, and they darted upwards to meet Achyuta’s gaze.<br>“That’s a good start,” he said. “I thought quite hard about how I could find, in reasonable time, a people who did not wish to be found – at first, I thought of monitoring food shipments and such—”<br>Achyuta snorted.<br>“—but obviously, if you were smart, you would simply grow your own food, irrigating your fields through groundwater, or hunt for it. So I thought next: what would you most certainly have the necessity to import, that you cannot produce yourself? I realized that a camp like yours would likely be planted with traps and such devices, and I started asking around for families where an engineer had gone missing recently.”<br>“And what did you find?”<br>“I found many such families, but of course none of them knew where they had gone. Your people are very confidential in your affairs, clearly.”<br>“Indeed.”<br>“So instead I looked at matters from the following perspective: if Magadha hasn’t found your hideout yet, that must mean a limitation in their maps. So I scoured over government maps of the Śūrasena country, and identified regions where the tracts labelled appeared to be incomplete, or where there seemed to be rough transitions in the landscape that indicated a region missing from the maps.”<br>“There must have been many such omittances. Did you check them all?”<br>“Then I compared these places to the sites of disappearances of Magadhi soldiers, tax collectors and other agents. Thus, I identified five possible locations for the site of your camp – this is the fourth of the sites that I checked.”<br>“Very clever,” Achyuta admitted grumpily. “I do not know to whom this is a greater embarrassment: to us, whose hideout was so easily exposed by a mere child, or to Magadha, who could not accomplish in so many years with their enormous number of military experts what a child did in a matter of fortnights. Who are you, boy?”<br>The boy slowly unwrapped his scarf to reveal his smiling lips: “You may call me Kautilya. And what I want from you is to coronate me as the Heir of Saṃkarṣaṇa – I desire, from you, the Seal of the Peacock.”]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/2/2.3.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/2/2.3.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 14:24:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[2.4]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>spies<br><br>“THE INSTITUTION OF SPIES”<br>PREFIX<br><br>in: THE KAUTILYA LECTURES<br>Delivered initially in [date:-336|magadha] at Takṣaśilā, Gandhāra to the following students:<br>
<br>Apratimaujas a Brāhmaṇa of Gokula, Śūrasena
<br>Daṇḍaśarman a Brāhmaṇa of Ujjain, Avanti
<br>Pāṇini a Brāhmaṇa of Śalātura, Gandhāra
<br>Pabbata a kṣatriya of Pāṭaliputra, Magadha
<br>Candragupta a kṣatriya of Pāṭaliputra, Magadha
<br>Śrībhānu a kṣatriya of Kuṇḍagrāma, Vṛji
<br>Transcribed later from memory by Śrībhānu for the benefit of the Yavana girl Tara.<br>Edited and organized at the word of Professor Cāṇakya by the Yavana lady Tara.<br><br>The security of a state depends on the loyalties of its elements of sovereignty: of the king, the minister, the treasury, the army, the fort, the country and the allies. There are numerous means of securing such loyalties, and there are numerous means for them to be secured or seized by the enemy. This game played between a king and his enemy is termed war.<br>A formal declaration does not mark the start of war, similarly a peace treaty does not mark its end, only that of open war. War is perpetual, in one form or the other, and a king cannot rest even after he has completed a conquest, for the continued possession of an article requires continued active participation in such war as it persists.<br>It is then asked: how can such mighty forces – a great army, great wealth, a great population and country, large numbers of secure fortresses, foreign kings, the intellect of ministers – be made loyal to the will of a king alone?<br>Bhāradvāja says the king must be like a lion in the forest: even though he is small in number, he is far too powerful to be defeated by animals that are more numerous.<br>Parāśara says he must be like a mahout controlling an elephant: even though he is weaker than the elephant, he is able to control it by virtue of his position and tools.<br>But these are not correct: a king need not be the mightiest of his country in either dimension of masculine strength: intellectual, physical or otherwise; indeed, such strengths may be suited to other economic pursuits than kingship. Nor may a country be compared to an elephant, as unlike an elephant it contains men with intellect and technology equal or superior to that of the king.<br>Thus, I say he must be like a sluice in a canal – or like any other machine.<br>“I believe that control over a large army requires a larger army,” says Pabbata, “And likewise for a treasury, a country, a fort, an ally, and an intellect. Is this not so?”<br>No, as such demands would be infinite – even if you secure frontier articles in this way, the capital would still remain unsecured, as the chaotic political history of Magadha attests. And although the Persians claim that they have achieved stability by seizing powerful articles away from the countries they conquer, this alone cannot guarantee stability, as the king still assigns these articles to his subordinates; furthermore such centralization is an obstacle to mobility; as a result, Persia is weak at fighting on multiple fronts.<br>Much as a small sluice controls a far more powerful current, much as a lever controls the heavy projectiles loaded onto a catapult, much as a switch controls the flow of activity to a mill from a load raised by a water-wheel; similarly large elements may be controlled by small ones placed strategically and with intrigue.<br>Such small elements are termed spies.<br>Spies are secret by default, and are not allowed to admit their role or source of income to even those close to them – why?<br>“Because wise counsel lies in not revealing what one has determined to carry out,” says Candragupta.<br>The goal of spies is to ensure loyalty among the elements of sovereignty. To this end, they carry out the following three types of operations:<br>
<br>gathering intelligence on and influencing the opinions and plans of ministers, officials, army, forts, country and allies
<br>scouting and affecting the same of an ally, enemy or neutral state
<br>conducting covert operations against an enemy
<br>A spy may allure various members to betray the king and test their loyalties in this way. Such allurement may be in the form of persuasion, bribery, threats or deceit.<br>
<br>Allurement by bribery is the most crucial as it is such methods that are used by enemies most frequently: bribery includes bribery by wealth, titles and positions of power, sexual favours and other incentives.
<br>Allurement by persuasion is second most crucial: a spy may speak ill of the king in confidence to the subject, and if the latter agrees, he may be disposed from his position as he is seen as susceptible to being turned by persuasion.
<br>Allurement by threats is crucial to maintain discipline among officials and the army: those who successfully resist such threats and report them to the king risking their lives may be heralded for their courage without making it publicly known that the threat was an intelligence operation.
<br>Allurement by deceit may be done to prevent subjects from having their superstitions exploited by tricks and contravariances used by the enemy.
<br>Thus the firmness, honesty, courage and intelligence of subjects may be tested by spies through the respective methods of gathering intelligence.<br>Spies may also conduct simpler listening and propaganda operations to the same end.<br>Likewise for spies scouting and affecting foreign countries and their articles.<br>Covert operations conducted by spies sabotage one or more of the enemy’s elements of sovereignty.<br>
<br>Sabotage of the king and minister is assassination, kidnapping, seduction of the queen, disruption of councils and other offenses against the person.
<br>Sabotage of forts and armies is infiltration; these involve replacing army men and merchandise with inferior quality or traitorous substitutes, and of smuggling weapons into forts.
<br>Sabotage of the treasury is looting.
<br>Sabotage of the country is the destruction or seizure of farm and mine produce, poisoning of streams and livestock, and the obstruction of roads.
<br>Sabotage of the ally is obstructing or falsifying messages sent and received by the enemy.
<br>The following applies to all kinds of spying operations: just as a chariot may be pulled by an excess of horses tied in such a way that the vehicle is still functional when one of them is slain, at least three spies should be issued independently towards one goal without being revealed to each other, and their reports should be checked to agree – this way, spies can be made to spy on one another, and their loyalties can be checked.<br>Similarly, the spies and the espionage institutions should not be known to each other. This is to prevent the formation of conspiracies against the government, and to prevent captured spies from revealing information that compromises other spies or operations of the government.<br>Similarly, spies should be trained to use special pre-defined symbols – if their tasks are sufficiently generic, they should be trained to communicate in cipher.<br>Spies must be recruited from all walks of life. Those in all four stages of life – students, householders, recluses and ascetics – may all be recruited. Of chief importance are merchants, prostitutes, cooks and such servants, respected heroes and colleagues of the subject being spied on.<br>Criminals are particularly useful as spies, especially when it is not known to themselves that they are being used as spies. Such spies may also be used in situations where it is necessary to make a show of executing the spy after the operation is conducted.<br>Finally, a king may keep a known traitor, corrupt official, criminal or incompetent in his government for several reasons, including: pooling of intelligence about other traitors from those who associate with the known traitor, centrally manipulating such other traitors through the known traitor, use as a scapegoat in public relations disasters, use as fodder in various operations.<br>

Spies set up by foreign kings shall also be found out by local spies; spies by spies of like profession. It is the institutes of espionage, secret or avowed, that set spies in motion.

<br>2.2_licchavi<br><br>[date:-480|flashback,x]<br>The king of Magadha laughed. Not a wicked sort of laugh that one may have expected from the caricatures of him in plays – a jovial and genuine laugh of amusement.<br>“I don’t know why you ever sent me a messenger, Great King,” he said lightly, addressing his rival, “I made my goals quite clear to you from the start, did I not? What would your messenger have negotiated?”<br>The Licchavi Chief smiled nervously.<br>“For that matter, what have you come to talk about?” Ajātaśatru continued. “I could kill you right now, you know, just as I did to the messenger,” —the Licchavis unsheathed their swords and acted offended; Ajātaśatru ignored them and addressed the courtiers— “What would you do about it? I’m the messenger now. Ooh don’t shoot the messenger! But what if the messenger shoots you? I jest, I jest. War between us will not benefit anybody. Besides me.” The Magadhi king bared his teeth.<br>Trying not to look appalled, the Licchavi Chief folded his hands: “Great King … I have come to surrender to you.”<br>“Oh? Could you not have just killed yourself? Please do not be offended! I would quite enjoy murdering you myself, Great King, but I am quite the busy man, you know.”<br>The Magadhi chortled heartily, his courtiers laughing alongside him, while his rival was sweating. He turned to the Licchavi Minister.<br>“Ah, Chief Minister!” he cried. “How stoic your face is – how manlily you stand! You must be so intelligent, so firm, so righteous! And yet you lose to me – a short Magadhi barbarian who regards himself a genius for having invented one intrigue, while in the Western realms, educated Brāhmaṇas like yourself revel in the study of hundreds of such devices of their own invention! Do you wish to know why, Chief Minister? Do you wish to know my secret – why I win, and you lose?”<br>The Chief Minister did not answer.<br>Ajātaśatru continued.<br>“Everywhere from Vaiśālī to Takṣaśilā, the Brāhmaṇas present themselves as the manly, decisive, realist defenders of Vedic civilization – of great ingenuity and strong morals – with a grand master-plan, to be playing an elaborate and complicated game, so that every loss is truly a step to an eventual victory – that they will never allow the great civilization of their construction to fall to a deranged lunatic like myself.”<br>–he pointed at his own ridiculous wolf-skin outfit–<br>“Beware the wolf in sheep’s skin, they say! But I say: beware the sheep in wolf’s skin! Beware a man who possesses no goals but takes false glory from the appearance of a cunning, ambitious genius! That is all that most men are: sheep! and it is cheap to pretend – and pretending to be a wolf gives you all the benefits you desire: the vulvas of well-endowed women, social respect, some royal titles and grants – mainly the vulvas of well-endowed women – but the achievement of no real goals in life. And that is the reason why I win and you lose–”<br>The Magadhi king’s expression turned sombre, and he made an exaggerated gesture of clutching his temple with his forefingers and sniffling.<br>“–because you truly do not even care about defeating me! You care about appearing to care about defeating me – because that speaks well of your sense of judgement of what ought to be, whether that signal is true or false.”<br>Ajātaśatru sniffled some more, then punched his own minister in the face to address him.<br>“Do you want to know what I care about, Varṣākāra? Showing what, for once, a wolf – not even in sheep’s clothing – in wolf’s clothing–” he drew attention to his own attire “–can accomplish in a world of sheep. And that lesson, however expensive or destructive it may be, will be greatly beneficial to the world!”<br>“Will it?” asked a courtier. Varṣākāra sighed internally as the king of Magadha sliced the annoyance in two.<br>“Will it?” Ajātaśatru mimicked. “I DON’T KN— I DON’T CARE if it is beneficial! That was a lie! I spoke, in very clear terms, about what I cared about: showing what one wolf can accomplish in a world of sheep. If that is all I care about, obviously I’m lying when I say that is motivated by an even deeper desire to benefit the world. Oh, but Ajātaśatru, why did you lie? Why did you put on a pretense, why did you flash some sheep skin for a moment? Because I knew some idiot would say WILL IT REALLY? and I could then make an example out of him, and go on this whole rant; there are so many levels to my thinking, too deep for all your small intellects to comprehend, thus furthering my goal of demonstrating what a wolf can do in a world of sheep—” he gestured to those seated around him, “—Oh, and maybe I should just behead all of you, because you just believed the explanation I gave you for what I said and did, believed that I truly anticipated and predicted the reaction in advance and plotted it all, much like the foolish Licchavi Chief who believed this about his Minister, and now you do not know what to believe, thus furthering my goal of demonstrating what a wolf can do in a world of sheep.”<br><br>

 <br><br>2.3_mother<br><br>[date:-475|flashback,x]<br>“And then what did you do, Father-sir?”<br>“Luring them into a false sense of security by feigning defeat, I sent a group of prostitutes to distract Kulvalaka and the other Licchavis and break the chain of command, allowing my agents to seize the city before their confused eyes.”<br>“Brilliant, Father-sir!”<br>“That is NOT what you should be saying, Udayin. What should you be saying?”<br>Udayin considered the question for a half-second. “The prostitutes achieved what your catapults couldn’t. Thus, they are a threat to your supremacy.” The crown prince gulped. “What did you do to them, Father-sir?”<br>Ajātaśatru scrunched up his face as if confused by the question. “Why, I simply beheaded them, of course. It would be quite silly to employ a more torturous method – like cutting them into small shreds starting from the fingertips, or pouring molten metal down their throat, or chaining their limbs to those of elephants and having them slowly be torn apart, or placing them between spiked plates as they are pressed together by boulders dropped by cranes. Those are the methods to be employed against my enemies or against ordinary subjects for fun, not against those who have served me – I wouldn’t want my subjects afraid of serving me, after all.”<br>One could sense some nervousness in Udayin’s laugh, and this annoyed the Emperor to no end, but he decided against beating his son this time. This time, he would use Udayin’s favourite sex slave before his eyes – yes, that would be an appropriate punishment.<br>When the silence was finally broken, it was by Queen-Mother Chellana.<br>Ajātaśatru, upon being coronated, had shown mercy upon his own mother – while he had imprisoned his father and had been subjecting him to regular torture for the past seventeen years, the former queens had been shown much kindness: he generously employed his brothers’ mothers as prostitutes for the most distinguished commanders and champions in his armies, while his own mother, for her kind act of birthing him, was allowed to roam the palace freely and continued to enjoy her former chamber (of course, she had also been caned severely during the purge as a warning against making too many annoying moralizing chastisements against the king).<br>“There is a request I wish to make, son,” she said weakly. Ajātaśatru noticed that she had been crying – probably something to do with how he had just mercilessly massacred her old relations in Vaiśālī. Oh, but Ajātaśatru, you’re my son, you shouldn’t murder my cousins! You shouldn’t raze my city to the ground and go around suffocating its aristocrats by chaining them to the bottom of a pit and slowly pouring wet sand over them! Typical woman.<br>“Go on,” the king said with a sigh. He was quite kind that way.<br>“I have asked this of you, before, son … but I hope that you will grant me my boon this time … at least seeing your mother in this distraught state … ”<br>“This again? OH, I WANT TO SEE MY HUSBAND AGAIN, I’M LONELY, AND ALL MY SON TALKS ABOUT IS MURDERING PROSTITUTES AND MONKS. If you so desperately wish for a man’s company, Mother, then Varṣākāra is exhibiting his endowments quite publicly.”<br>Queen-Mother Chellana covered her face in horror.<br>Ajātaśatru ignored her.<br>“Son … if you ever felt that your father and I did not treat you well when you were young, that we did not respect your talents as we should have … then it is not your father you should blame … it is me.”<br>Ajātaśatru rolled his eyes. “The typical self-sacrifice. Ah, yes, it was my mother who preferred the sons of her husband’s other wives – if that is so, Mother, then I must say I have even less respect for you now than before—”<br>“I threw you into the garbage dump when you were born, son!” Queen-Mother Chellana was sobbing.<br>“When you were conceived, I had these horrid dreams – of consuming my husband’s heart – I never dreamed of doing any harm, of course, just … I went to a seer and asked him what these dreams meant, and he told me it meant my son would have the heart of a monster, cold, wicked and devoid of any compassion. That he would feel neither remorse nor disgust at even cannibalism, and that there was no method of nurture that would change this, it was predetermined … ”<br>Ajātaśatru’s expression was blank.<br>“I couldn’t bring myself to abort you. I just couldn’t … you were my son. To do such a thing would be a betrayal of your father’s love for me, and an insult to mine for him. And yet when you were born, when I saw the eyes of the monster you were prophesied to become, the monster I had brought into this world … I … I … ”<br>A weaker man would have accused: It is YOUR fault that I grew up to be a monster, Mother! What else would you expect from a child who was treated by his own mother as a freak of prophecy? The prophecy was self-fulfilling – the only reason it was made because the monk knew what sort of a depraved woman you were, and predicted the outcome of your upbringing.<br>But not Ajātaśatru. For it was irrelevant what factors had influenced him to become the way he was – for all it mattered, a butterfly could have flapped its wings and altered the course of history to cause him to be born, but he had no cause to honour that butterfly. Whatever he was, it was the product of his own decisions, and those decisions were the product of what his personality had been before. Further causation was irrelevant.<br>And he was proud of what he was.<br>“Your father heard of what I had done, and dived into the garbage dump himself to find his beloved child, for that is what you’ve always been to him, whether or not he showered you with the requisite affection. When he found you, you were wounded and sickly, having been picked and bitten by various filthy animals, covered with ashes … and you had a boil on your finger. Your father is, as you say, a barbarian – he did not know how to treat the boil, or to bring you to a medical practitioner. So he took your finger in his mouth and sucked the pus out of it himself, caring not even for his own life, caring only for the slightest chance that his son survives.”<br>The king’s eyes were red.<br>“That is the truth of your father, son. He cared for you like he cared for no other person in the world.”<br>“Is … is that so?” Ajātaśatru’s acting was so natural, that anyone who was not already familiar with his nature and behaviour would not have been able to even tell that it was a façade. “I never knew, mother. I … I will go and free him immediately.”<br>Queen-Mother Chellana’s eyes widened in horror, but Ajātaśatru was gone before she could protest.<br>

When under the temptation of youth, he turns his eye towards women, impure women under the disguise of Āryas shall, at night and in lonely places, terrify him; when fond of liquor, he shall be terrified by making him drink drugged liquor; when fond of gambling, he shall be terrified by spies under the disguise of fraudulent persons; when fond of hunting, he shall be terrified by spies under the disguise of highway robbers; and when desirous of attacking his own father, he shall, under the pretence of compliance, be gradually persuaded of the evil consequences of such attempts, by telling: a king is not made by a mere wish; failure of thy attempt will bring about thy own death; success makes thee fall into hell and causes the people to lament for thy father and destroy the only clod, i.e. thyself.

<br>[date:-329|magadha,x]<br>Pabbata was worried.<br>Seven years ago, when he had first met Cāṇakya, he had regarded the latter as an intelligent fool – a boy genius, no doubt, but painfully naïve and oblivious to the ways of manipulation. He had been so confident that he would effortlessly beat Cāṇakya in his own game, one way or another, that he had made no precautions against whatever plots Cāṇakya himself may have been making against him.<br>He should have corrected this belief when the boy had broken out of the most secure prisons, designed by Emperor Ajātaśatru himself, by manipulating his prison guards.<br>He should have corrected this belief upon witnessing the degree of admiration and worship that the Gandhāras possessed for the Brāhmaṇa boy.<br>He should have corrected this belief when he heard Cāṇakya’s lecture on the ways of manipulation, and his extensive descriptions of such techniques in various contexts in his other lectures; when he had displayed his knowledge of precisely those postures of manipulation that Pabbata had been trying against Cāṇakya.<br>But he had told himself, repeatedly, that Cāṇakya’s knowledge was only theoretical, that he would be utterly ineffectual in implementing it without Pabbata’s support. But upon observing Cāṇakya’s odd request unfold into a beautifully-executed heist that liberated the entirety of Punjab from Persian rule while also ensuring – at least for the time being – their freedom from Magadha, Pabbata had to reconsider all that he had believed about his Professor.<br>Now in the cosy confines of Cāṇakya’s residence, as Pabbata played Rājamaṇḍala huddled around a fire with the rest of the gurukula, he felt more dread than fondness or nostalgia.<br>“I believe you are the spy, Professor,” he said, “I must execute you.”<br>Cāṇakya sighed. “Emperor … ” he said softly, “Why do you distrust me so?”<br>The said Professor was eighteen this year. They had last seen each other five years ago, and had been apart for a rather formative period – even if Pabbata had ever been right in his assessment of Cāṇakya, the boy had quite likely lost any such innocence that had been true of him in the past.<br>(Pabbata found himself assassinated by Apratimaujas upon the next waking as a result of his unfounded suspicion of Cāṇakya.)<br>But most dreadful of all were Pabbata’s newfound worries about Candragupta’s loyalties.<br>Sweet, loyal, upright Candragupta.<br>Five years ago, Pabbata would never have suspected a blemish in his sidekick’s character – nor would he have distrusted Candragupta to ever change when not under his influence. But whether as a consequence of Candragupta’s loss of innocence, or Pabbata’s own – Pabbata found himself fearing that even Candragupta may have been turned by Cāṇakya, that his blind trust in Candragupta was irrationally wishful, that naked, Pabbata truly had no allies.<br>Candragupta collected the seals and props and placed them in a bag, while Śrībhānu collected the fuel to prepare for bedtime.<br>Cāṇakya stood up, and Pabbata noticed that the Professor’s relaxed expression had given away to a far more serious one.<br>“Pabbata and Candragupta, there is something that we must talk about. The rest of you will go to sleep.”<br>scheme_2<br><br><br>
A spy, under the guise of an astrologer, may describe to a chief the destiny of a maiden who is at the point of being married to another, and say: “This man’s daughter deserves to be the wife of a king, and will bring forth a son destined to be a king; purchase her with all your wealth, or seize her by force.” When it is not possible to secure her, spies should enrage the parties; but when she is secured quarrel will necessarily ensue.
A mendicant woman may tell a chief who is fond of his wife: “This (another) chief, proud of his youth, has sent me to entice your wife; being afraid of him, I have taken with me his letter and jewellery (for your wife); your wife is free from sin; secret steps should be taken against him; and I am very anxious (about your success).”
Thus in these and other kinds of brawls which have originated of themselves or which have been brought about by spies, the conqueror should help the inferior party with men and money and set them against the wicked or cause them to migrate (to other parts of the country).

<br>2.4_father<br><br>[date:-475|flashback,x]<br>“Father,” Ajātaśatru addressed politely, “I have come to make amends.”<br>The former king Bimbisāra looked up weakly from where he was sprawled, his body skeletal and his skin covered with filthy bruises. His one remaining eye opened slowly to behold his son, whose face shone with kindness towards his father for the first time in the forty years of his life.<br>“… son?”<br>The king helped his father up, and continued to hold him when he realized the old man could not stand.<br>“Mother told me everything. About my birth. And who rescued me.”<br>“Yes … Varṣākāra was quite fond of you.”<br>Ajātaśatru’s face turned stone-cold.<br>“He risked his life for you … did she tell you about the boil on your finger—”<br>Bimbisāra screamed and begged, flailed like a chicken being dragged to slaughter, with more energy than he had mustered in over a decade – as Ajātaśatru dragged him by what remained of his scalp-hair, and nailed his hands and feet to wooden planks.<br>“You lying, lying hypocrites,” he spat, then mimicked: “Oh, he cared for you like no other person— lies! All. Blatant. Lies!”<br>The Emperor of Magadha grabbed his sword and slashed at his father’s frail body, relishing in the whimpers that came out of the aged man’s face.<br>“LOOK HOW QUICKLY YOU TURNED WHEN I OFFERED YOU MERCY!

His poor, poor father had seen his son approaching to free him, and thought: he is surely visiting to kill me! and committed suicide to spare his son of the sin of patricide.<br>Second (and this was said between Queen-Mother Chellana’s hysterical sobs), Queen-Mother Vajirakumari Chellana would be granted her wish of being reunited with her husband.<br>Third (and this was said as Queen-Mother Chellana’s bloodied body was carried out of the room by servants), Udayin – who had so far been known to be a very poor shot as an archer – was now skilled enough to practice archery on ornaments placed on the heads of live people, and Varṣākāra had been chosen for this honour.<br>Fourth (and this was said as Varṣākāra’s flailing self was dragged out of the room), adding to the tragedies – and this was known to no one else yet – Chief Queen Vapuṣmatī had succumbed to mysterious injuries and died in her cell. Yet another accident in the royal harem.<br>Fifth (and this was said to an increasedly worried audience in an atmosphere that had considerably darkened), as a result of all these tragedies, the Rajagriha palace now appeared to be ridden with only sorrow for him, and the capital was to be shifted to the nearby town of Pāṭaliputra; preparations would be underway immediately.<br>“Oh,” said Ajātaśatru, his ears perking up like he had just remembered something, “Right – the fourth thing hasn’t happened yet. Ha, it is as if I just spoiled the ending of a play for you! I’ll be right back.”<br>parenting<br><br><br>

<br>The two students set cross-legged apart from their Professor, who held them with a stern gaze.<br>Pabbata was nervous. Candragupta appeared relatively calm.<br>“One who does not know his goals cannot win,” said Cāṇakya. “And yet in all our deliberations so far, Pabbata, we have acted coy about our this, about what benefits we seek from each other. There are many reasons we have adopted this posture, without speaking of our goals explicitly, but now you are old enough, as is Candragupta, and possess sufficient wit that there is no longer any advantage to be held in keeping this from you.”<br>Pabbata held his breath.<br>“I am testing you both as prospective future kings of Magadha,” Cāṇakya announced, making his worst fears come true, “On the basis of that qualities that you possess, as they are true and as they are perceived by the elements of Magadha’s sovereignty. I have not made my decision yet, for it is a difficult one, and I might not make it for a very long time.”<br>This time it was Candragupta who cast a nervous glance in Pabbata’s direction, as if he wished to say that he had no idea about any of these plans of the Professor; Pabbata held Cāṇakya’s gaze.<br>“What are these qualities, Professor?” he asked steadily.<br>But Cāṇakya ignored him. “I will say this much, however – if either of you ends up dead, then the entire project will be discarded, and I will start afresh with a new crop of candidates. And if I end up dead … well, let us say the world will have to wait for another candidate for my place in all this. So it is in your best interests to ensure that neither of you comes to any harm.”<br>Pabbata did not quite believe that Cāṇakya would simply discard all the efforts he had invested into Pabbata – who else could he even find? – but did know that Cāṇakya could be rather unpredictable in many ways, and might justify such an act with an argument like “As one should not cry over spilt milk, it is not the sunk cost that is worth considering while deciding to discard a project, but the future benefit and loss; the same applies to identifying when one has to surrender, for the fact that one is making great losses of men and wealth is an indicator of future defeat, and not an argument to make further losses”, or “There is logical cause to have oneself be known as a man who adheres to his word, so that one can effectively use the means of dāma and daṇḍa to influence behavior, and for this purpose one should abide by oaths even when it seems irrational, and it is for this purpose that scholarly institutions, noble lines and mercantile guilds and families bother so much about their reputation” – so Pabbata did not wish to take the risk of angering his Professor. After all, if it came to be that Cāṇakya preferred Candragupta to him, Pabbata could always have his rival killed after.<br>It was much easier, he realized, to make Candragupta look bad.<br>And so Pabbata came up with a diabolical plan of his own.<br>gordian<br><br><br>
On another occasion, Cāṇakya wished to test the youths, so while Candragupta was sleeping, he ordered Pabbata to remove his woolen thread without breaking it or waking the owner, which Pabbata was unable to do. When Candragupta was set the problem, however, he solved it after the manner of Alexander and the Gordian knot: he cut off Pabbata’s head, and Cāṇakya was not the man to be displeased at this.

If you are truly the most powerful king in the world, and I your queen, then why, in all these years, have I seen nothing but the inside of a dungeon smelling of horse faeces?”<br>“More pretences that I am expected to uphold! Some kings build a palace the size of a city for their queens, I’ll keep mine in a cage with rats and flies. Say another thing that annoys me and I will have to dispose of you.”<br>“Really, you’ll dispose of me, my Lord?” Vapuṣmatī batted her eyelashes seductively.<br>“You are beginning to annoy me once more, my Queen.”<br>“Will you truly have the heart to let go of a beauty such as mine?”<br>“That beauty is fading already, and will last barely four or five more years. Your annoying nature will persist for much longer, if I do nothing about it.”<br>Vapuṣmatī laughed at first, then seemed to turn a little uncomfortable as Ajātaśatru stayed silent.<br>“ … you jest … right?”<br>It was when Ajātaśatru unsheathed his dagger that her discomfort turned into fear, to desperation, and finally to dread.<br>“My Lord … my Ruler … you know the affection that I have for you, how much respect I hold for you in my mind, and in reality … I beseech you, you are the hero who saved me, who won me … I beseech you, my Lord—”<br>Stab.<br>“And how am I to know that this is any different from my father’s supposed affection for me when he needed something out of me?” The Emperor’s voice was not cruel, merely cold and emotionless, and that only made it all much worse.<br>“I beseech you, my Lord … there is no one in these three worlds who knows you, who understands you like I do … and while even the gods worship you, they do not do so with the same devotion that I have toward you. It is not death that I fear, it is the betrayal – you know me – your company is all I have ever desired in life … I beg you, do not take that away from me.”<br>But all her pleas fell on deaf ears.

I assure you that this is part of my own game against the enemies of Magadha, and that you will see the fruits of this game in due time.<br>I am not so naïve as to instantly believe Cāṇakya’s dismissal of Candragupta, that I will accept this as proof of his fair-handedness in the contest, or that losing both his supposed candidates he will truly start anew or abandon his cause. I believe it is possible that this is a plot by him to lure me into a false sense of comfort.<br>I request that you send a batch of spies to capture Cāṇakya and Candragupta and bring them to Magadha. For all the same reasons as before, it is essential that they be captured alive.<br>Furthermore, I ask for permission to use the king’s seal once.<br>omniscience<br><br><br>
Proclamation of his omniscience is as follows: rejection of his chief officers when their secret domestic and other private affairs are known; revealing the names of traitors after receiving information from spies specially employed to find out such men; pointing out the impolitic aspect of any course of action suggested to him; and pretensions to the knowledge of foreign affairs by means of his power to read omens and signs invisible to others when information about foreign affairs is just received through a domestic pigeon which has brought a sealed letter.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 13.1:2
<br>Cāṇakya received the pigeon on his rooftop and unfurled the cotton-paper letter received from his spy.<br>“What does it say?” asked Pāṇini.<br>“Exactly as I suspected,” said Cāṇakya. “Pabbata considers this to be the best opportunity to present himself as an almost-martyred hero in Magadha. He intends to decide, based on the fruits of his actions, whether to gain power from the inside, by executing me, or from the outside, by having me pardoned and taking my support as I had offered it. That is why he wishes me alive, and why he asked the king for the imperial seal.”<br>“And so what do you plan? Will you go into hiding?”<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>Cāṇakya descended the staircase and at the central shrine for Yājñavalkya, struck the temple bell, attracting the attention of those of the university, as well as of every other human soul in Gandhāra, who stopped whatever they were doing to listen to Cāṇakya’s words.<br>“Hear, hear! Professors and students of Takṣaśilā, I wish for this to be known to you: I believe Prince Pabbata to be alive—”<br>Gasps.<br>“—however, after Candragupta’s betrayal of my explicit word, I also possess equal cynicism for Pabbata’s goals, and paranoia that he will simply betray me to the Magadhi emperor. Thus, I am forced to go into hiding myself, and must promise to see you all again.”<br>passport<br><br><br>
Weapons and armour shall be entered into the armoury only after they are marked with the king's seal. Persons with weapons shall not be allowed to move anywhere unless they are permitted by a passport. When weapons are either lost or spoilt, the superintendent shall pay double their value; an account of the weapons that are destroyed shall be kept up. Boundary-guards shall take away the weapons and armour possessed by caravans unless the latter are provided with a passport to travel with weapons.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 5.3:37-41
<br>It was with a small army that Pabbata returned to Takṣaśilā.<br>For even though Gandhāra did not share a border with Magadha, it was afraid of directly engaging against a Magadhi force in fear of a retaliatory trade war or covert war. Thus, the king’s officials attempted to negotiate with Pabbata as the guards stormed the courtyards at the break of dawn, questioning the target’s associates on his whereabouts.<br>It was to the threat of torture that Pāṇini revealed Cāṇakya to be taking shelter with the Aśvakāyanas – the tribe of Queen Kṛpā with whom Cāṇakya had earlier formed an alliance in his plot against the Persians. At this, Pabbata ordered his guards to stop the grilling.<br>“This is very well, then, prince!” said a young soldier enthusiastically, “We shall go to Kamboja, interrogate the Aśvakāyanas, locate Cāṇakya in their country and capture him!”<br>“Is that truly necessary?” asked another idiot, “Cāṇakya said he will return to Takṣaśilā, we could simply lay here stealthily in wait.”<br>At this, Pabbata understood the value of intelligent company, and revealed the King’s seal, announcing, with no room for contradiction, walking past his allies and the royals of Gandhāra who had come to negotiate, that he will go there himself, and apprehend Cāṇakya himself.<br>protect_army<br><br><br>
Of troops which have lost their leader or which are not trained, those that have lost their leader may be taken to fight under the leadership of a different person but not the troops which are not trained.
Removal of vices and troubles, recruitment (of new men), keeping away from places of an enemy's ambush, and harmony among the officers of the army, are the means of protecting the army from troubles.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 8.5:17-18
<br>As Pabbata thought, Cāṇakya had anticipated an attack and had set up an ambush for his safety. After demonstrating that he was alone and without any contravariances or conspiracy (and secretly fearing a possible plot by Cāṇakya that involved killing him for some reason), he was finally able to extract Cāṇakya from his hiding spot and have him extract the camouflaged archers and snake charmers from the woods.<br>“You had a whole ambush planned out, as I expected,” said Pabbata, exuding respect, “You had Pāṇini warn you in advance about my approach, and if I were arriving with an army, you would have interpreted that as an attempt to capture you.”<br>Cāṇakya nodded thoughtfully. “Out of curiosity, why didn’t you do that? You could have marched to Magadha a hero, having apprehended a dangerous enemy of the state.”<br>The prince feigned an expression of hurt. “I am shocked that you would insinuate such a thing of me, Professor – that you would expect such an ungrateful act of me.”<br>Cāṇakya raised an eyebrow. “Do you truly so value our friendship? … Out of curiosity, what happened, exactly, when you supposedly died?”<br>This question surprised Pabbata, who asked: “Haven’t you figured it out already, Professor?”<br>“I have multiple hypotheses.”<br>“I faked my death myself, of course.”<br>“Indeed, that was the hypothesis I was almost certain of.”<br>“Do you think less of me now, Professor?”<br>It was a half-minute later that Cāṇakya finally responded to this enquiry, and when he did so, his voice was soft.<br>“Do you know why I revealed my plans to you two so explicitly, Pabbata?”<br>Pabbata considered the question. “I assumed it was because you knew I was already suspicious of your intents.”<br>“Then what use would it have done me to confirm those suspicions? No, Pabbata. It was a test. If I tell you precisely what I wanted from you – and yet forbade you the most obvious means of achieving that goal, how are you to play? That is the nature of problems one encounters in the practical world – for if there was an easy way to achieve your goal, there would be another who would have already done so. And yet you found a solution – this requires creativity; this requires ambition.”<br>“Are you merely flattering me, Professor?”<br>“It is no secret, prince, that I do not regard you as an ideal candidate for a king. However, you are better than any alternatives I know of. Candragupta has many great qualities, but as he has demonstrated in his response to my test, he lacks ambition. He did not protest when I expelled him – did not attempt to stage a coup against me, and did not attempt to locate you so as to expose your plot and earn back my favour.”<br>Pabbata’s chest swelled as he heard these words. He had often been troubled by that very question – of what it was that made him and Candragupta so different, despite the latter’s admitted goodness – what it was that made Pabbata fit to be king, and Candragupta fit to be only his minion. To hear the answer to this expressed in such rational terms added a certain genuineness to Cāṇakya’s words, and Pabbata believed him.<br>“Between men who seek to be great, and men who seek to be good,” Cāṇakya continued, “Those who seek greatness often achieve a great deal more good than those who seek merely to do good, because the latter tend to underestimate their true capacities, lack the creativity to achieve great ambitions, and satiate their desires with small, token acts of goodwill. I say this not to flatter you, Pabbata, but to remind you to never lose that spirit of ambition. I do not regret sending Candragupta away. But he is intelligent and loyal, and I believe that he may serve you well – I will continue to tempt him with the prospect of power and betrayal, and use him to secure loyalty to you among the kingdoms of Punjab and Sindh.”<br>Pabbata felt himself sigh, regretting, half in jest, the day that he met Cāṇakya and decided to court his support. They were back to this game – of the art of double-crossing – and Pabbata simply had to trust that in the end it will not be him who will be betrayed. Why couldn’t things ever be simple with this man?<br>“Their loyalty to me, Cāṇakya?” he asked, “In what context, precisely?”<br>“For now, in your war for the throne of Pāṭaliputra. And later, to you as the Emperor of all the land from the Mountains beyond eagles’ reach to the Eastern Ocean – of Āryāvarta undivided.”<br>caste<br><br><br>
He went to Gautama Haridrumata and said to him: “I wish to become your student, Sir – may I come to you, Sir?” He said to him: “Of what family are you, my friend?”
He replied: “I do not know, Sir, of what family I am. I asked my mother, and she answered – in my youth when I had to move about much as a servant, I conceived thee; I do not know of what family thou art; I am Jabala by name, thou art Satyakāma (analogous, Philalethes). I am therefore Satyakāma Jabala, Sir.
He said to him: “No one but a true Brāhmaṇa would speak so honestly. Go and fetch fuel, friend, I shall initiate you as a Brāhmaṇa. You have not swerved from the truth.”
—Chandogya Upanishad 4.4-9.
<br>2.6_letter<br><br>O Dīrghachāryaṇa, most illustrious scholar of the sixteen great kingdoms,<br>I have no cause to intimate you of Ajātaśatru’s plans of invading your prosperous country – you are surely already aware of this, as he has made his intentions very clear to anyone who cares to hear him. I am writing to you, in secret, rather than to be read in the court of Ayodhya, for I seek to forge an alliance with you – not with the king of Ayodhya, but with you directly.<br>Ordinary alliances are made on the basis of mutual interest, but I make a far costlier request from you: I ask that we forge an alliance, not for the interests of our respective kingdoms, but for the interest of Vedic civilization at large. For the goal of protecting the Vedas and the Civilized Tongue, the sciences, the culture of free thought and chaste behaviour – from the barbarism that is Ajātaśatru’s expanding empire.<br>We cannot regard this as a mere conflict between kingdoms. As a conflict between ideas, I fear that this will be only the first of centuries of war. This is why I choose to speak with you, rather than to the king, for as a Brāhmaṇa, your service, beyond your capacity as Chief Minister of Ayodhya, is to the preservation of civilization.<br>It was unwise of Ayodhya and Vaiśālī to swap daughters in marriage to forge alliances with Magadha – unwise to trust the Magadhas so. I am afraid that Ayodhya’s nobility has become too invested in this alliance to consider my suggestions – that the wisdom and the glory of the ancient Raghu line is lost on the current king, this is why I choose to speak with you.<br>I believe that Ajātaśatru, as he has already taken Vaiśālī, will first attack your vassals in Kāśī, insisting on maintaining your alliance through some technical pretexts that the king will accept out of laziness or lack of foresight – then once he has consolidated power there, he will seize Ayodhya itself.<br>He must be stopped before he reaches Mathura. I request your co-operation in all matters.<br>Krishna.]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/2/2.5.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/2/2.5.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 14:27:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[3 Yavana Kāṇḍa]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br><br>obtain_woman<br><br><br>
The man who is ingenious and wise, who is accompanied by a friend, and who knows the intentions of others, as also the proper time and place for doing everything, can gain over, very easily, even a woman who is very hard to be obtained.
—Vatsyayana, in the Kāma Sutra, 1.5
<br>[date:-329|magadha,x]<br>All human actions are transactions, including the pleasurable interactions between a man and a woman.<br>When, due to the difficulty of the task or the beholder’s lack of intellectual capacities, the value of a transaction becomes difficult to judge, the beholder resorts to relying on the judgement of others. This is how even the uneducated know to pay respects to scholars of intellectual and masculine gait and clothing, and this is why a woman’s admiration of a man is based on his appraisal by others; while among civilized women these others are her parents, among barbarians, these are her companions of similar age.<br>Such people may be deceived easily by adopting false appearances. Thus the argument for why a government must be wary of heretical ascetics – for it is the one fatal folly of the Āryas, that we are inclined to trust the words of anyone who lives in self-imposed poverty, dons a simple garb and speaks platitudes of peace and mysticism.<br>Why, one might ask, had Professor Cāṇakya tasked his dearest student with the assignment of seducing Scythian women at a feast in Puṣkalāvatī?<br>Typically, the method of seduction was employed by female spies to extract information from important men – but the Scythians had the fatal habit of disclosing secrets to women to impress them – apart from women who themselves held political power. Minor leaks and rumours were thus widely circulated in gossip, but the wives and mistresses of men of true importance were somewhat more cautious about whom they chose to share their husbands’ secrets with, and thus extracting these secrets required more effort.<br>While men tended to reveal secrets in order to lay with a woman, the Professor had explained, women tended to reveal secrets after laying with a man – for they regarded their own affections as trust, and to reveal secrets then felt no different to them from revealing secrets to their husbands.<br>Of all the tasks that Cāṇakya had ever assigned him, none had made Candragupta – no, Śaśigupta – quite as nervous as this one. He had faltered in the past – not realizing that unlike civilized women, Bāhlīka women were not charmed by teaching them facts of geometry and grammar.<br>You are the protégé of the greatest living mind in the world, he reminded himself.<br>You are a man of civilization, amongst lowly barbarians.<br>If all these ordinary men could achieve this task – then what challenge could it be to Śaśigupta, with his status, stature, intellect, wit and large frontal sinus? How foolish was it then for him to lack confidence?<br>You are the future emperor of the world (a tinge of guilt hit him then, for he wasn’t sure what Cāṇakya’s plans were with Pabbata) – these women would regard it an honour to have ever received your attention; such will fill your harem; how silly would your current nervousness appear then?<br>Steeling himself, Śaśigupta strode his way into the midst of a group of drunken women, outstretched his right arm to hold out one of the red fruits of the Bāhlīka country, and announced:<br>“TO THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ONE!”<br>apple<br><br><br>
Zeus is said to have invited to the wedding of Peleus and Thetis all the gods except Eris (the goddess of discord). When she came later and was not admitted to the banquet, she threw an apple through the door, inscribed: To the Fairest One.
—Pseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 92 (The Judgement of Paris)
<br>2.7_ayodhya_1<br><br>[date:-465|flashback,x]<br>That morning in the city altar of Ayodhya, a sheep was sacrificed.<br>Emperor Ajātaśatru received the news that the city’s king had been deposed by its Prime Minister, a certain Dīrghachāryaṇa.<br>“What is the message that they are sending us?” Prince Udayin thought aloud. “That they celebrate the destruction of their sheep-like administration, and welcome our rule? Or that their sheep of a king has been eliminated, and their new administration will be more effective in countering us?”<br>Ajātaśatru was annoyed by the question.<br>“It is irrelevant, my son,” he replied. “What it means is that their new administration is just as sheep-like and foolish as the previous. For if they were truly wolves, if they were truly my worthy enemies – or allies – they would not bother sending me any sort of message – much less a cryptic, poetic and meaningless one. The purpose of the ritual is not to send me any message of meaning, it is to IMPRESS me.”<br>“And even in that purpose, they have failed,” Udayin commented.<br>Yet, Ajātaśatru could not quite shake off the fear that he was, for the first time, fighting a mind equal to his own – not only in sheer intellect, but also in cunning and ambition.<br>Upon conquering Vaiśālī, Ajātaśatru had set his eyes on the patchwork of an empire that was Ayodhya’s: the supposed lion of the jungle, before whose sovereign’s very sandals the monarchs of the world bowed to. He had first urged the tribes of the Daṇḍaka forest to rebel against the rule of their region by South Kosala, the tributary established so many centuries ago by the famous Rāma of Ayodhya. To do so, he had sought the aid of Vidarbha, a distant Southern kingdom, and had Rukmiṇī, the princess of Vidarbha, betrothed to Śiśupāla, a chief of wild tribes who was Ajātaśatru’s puppet.<br>Shortly thereafter, Princess Rukmini had been mysteriously kidnapped, with clearly fabricated incriminating evidence of an inside-job by her father. This had left Ajātaśatru with two options: to forgive the Vidarbhas and appear weak to his own followers, or to sabotage his alliance with them.<br>But Ajātaśatru was not a fool who merely responded to circumstances – he was creative, he was intelligent, and he played on his own terms. Thus, he had sent spies to find the true culprits, and to locate Princess Rukmini – and had found her in Ayodhya under the care of Prime Minister Dīrghachāryaṇa. But rather than taking the obvious bait – of accusing Dīrghachāryaṇa, having him dismissed from employment and giving the Brāhmaṇas cause to rebel against the king and install a prince in Ayodhya less sympathetic to Magadha – he had chosen to instead plant false evidence incriminating the King of Ujjain, a faraway and irrelevant country, in Rukmini’s abduction.<br>However, it appeared that whoever he was playing the game against had anticipated even this, and planning yet another step in advance, had caused a regime change in Ujjain – placing on its throne an indignant, ambitious hothead by the name of Pradyota, who was so enraged by the accusation against him that he marched his army to Magadha, set waste to its countryside and seized large treasures, then returned to invade and conquer Vidarbha. It had not done Ajātaśatru well to earn the ire of Pradyota, who had now apparently become a rival empire-builder of his own, and had began to compete with him for the alliance of Ayodhya.<br>At last, after seven long years, Ajātaśatru had taken Kāśī with his own forces – and enslaving its population to fill his army once more, declared war on the centre of civilization itself: on the city of Ayodhya, the capital of the nation that had once dominated the Mahājanapadas like a lion among lesser beasts.<br>Through his march through their country, his army had been harassed by thieves, skirmishers, poisoning attempts and seers and spies sent to demoralize the superstitious members of his army. And after spending three years capturing strategic forts and defeating armies sent to intercept him, three years of dealing with unending guerrilla warfare – he had finally reached the frontiers of the city of Ayodhya itself, ready to cross its uncrossable moat, to penetrate its impregnable bounds, to scale its unscalable walls and conquer the invincible city.<br>The resistance put up by the city was unlike anything that Ajātaśatru had seen in any fort he had captured previously – and unlike anything he had expected from an enemy.<br>For every attack, the city launched a most creative and unusual defence or counter-attack – they had captured some of his mechanics to learn the secret of the catapult, and created, in response, a more powerful bow – the crossbow – based on the identical technology and mounted it on their walls to harass the invading army. When Ajātaśatru battered their walls with his catapults, they reinforced it with rawhides and metal fibres to soften his blows; when he attempted to burn their fortifications by launching jugs of oil and fire-arrows at them, they repurposed their oil cauldrons – which were designed to be used against siege towers – to hurl water down the walls and extinguish the fires; when the Magadhas took advantage of lowered visibility from the smoke and steam to charge the doors with armoured elephants equipped with battering rams, the defenders located them with sound. The Magadhas sowed confusion by beating drums, but even when they made a hole in the wall at last, the insides were defended – not by archers as Ajātaśatru had anticipated, but by fiery traps that instantly killed the invaders; when Ajātaśatru sent in soldiers in wet clothing to avoid the flames, the fiery traps were supplemented by spike traps.<br>The Emperor of the Magadhas was impressed.<br>“Are we doomed?” asked his foolish son.<br>Ajātaśatru laughed. “Our goal is not to win a battle, silly boy. Our goal is the extermination of the people of Ayodhya – and there are many means to accomplish this. We employ this method because it is the most fun.”<br>All across civilized world – from the University at Takṣaśilā to the Port at Tāmraliptī, from the snowy mountains in the North to the ordinary ones in the South, in royal courts and in the Annual Debates in Yājñavalkya’s honour, in the camps of the defenders and the attackers alike, a mysterious name formed on the lips of men.<br>gita_3<br><br><br>
Air, water, earth, fire, sky, mind, intelligence and ego together constitute the nature created by me.
—quoted to Krishna, Bhagavad Gītā 7.4
<br>2.7_ayodhya_2<br><br>[date:-461|flashback,x]<br>After four full years of siege, Ayodhya fell.<br>More holes were made in the walls of Ayodhya; more sections became controlled by the invaders as defending them all became a war on too many fronts.<br>Pradyota of Ujjain, whose assistance had been requested by Ayodhya, found himself embroiled in a civil war against a rebellious Vidarbha. When the rebellion had finally been suppressed, the Magadhas put ruin to the roads from his country, stalling him.<br>The armies of Ayodhya continued to put a fierce resistance to Ajātaśatru even upon the breach of their walls – almost as if their goal was not victory itself, but merely to destroy as much of the Magadhi army as possible. As if they wished for the destruction of their own army, only so that it did not become Magadha’s when they were inevitably defeated.<br>“Your arrogance will be your downfall!” cried Dīrghachāryaṇa as he was tortured before the city’s central shrine.<br>“Arrogance, arrogance! – the three worlds chant without end: arrogance!” Ajātaśatru laughed heartily, “I’ve become a monster, and I love it! Why? Because I’ve become the greatest of them – all your tales, all your plays will be edited in due time to make arrogance the antagonist’s greatest weakness. All your villains will be moulded on me, and my personality, due to my wickedness. I love it!”<br>Ordinarily, Ajātaśatru would have dismissed Ayodhya’s actions as an irrational display of false bravery – but having experienced his enemy’s genius for himself, he could not quite help but consider that their actions were motivated by strategy: that the enemy lied beyond Ayodhya, and was seeking not merely to save Ayodhya, but something far greater.<br>A cold, calculating intellect much like his own.<br>He mouthed two syllables.<br>“Kr̥ṣṇa.”]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/3/3.1.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/3/3.1.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 14:27:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[3.2]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>[date:-327|magadha,x]<br>Even King Puruṣottama – foremost of Kṣatriyas, at one hundred and twenty six two-third-inches in height, mightiest and most knowledgeable, unmatched in his righteousness and in his commitment to the protection of his kingdom and the Vedic way – was outshined by the sharp eyes of his honoured guest whom he had bowed before.<br>“It is true that defensive wars are easier to fight than offensive ones, in general,” said the young Professor in a conciliatory voice, “Yet my attack on the Persians was at an opportune moment – for us. Alexander’s attack will be in an opportune moment – for him. Either one must wait for an opportune moment, or train to make a moment opportune – but we do not have the same information about Alexander’s army or strategy that he may have about us.”<br>The famed scholar who sat across from the king – who had already accrued great repute by causing the Persians to retreat from the borders of the civilized world – who had for a long time now occupied the king’s utmost respects, with the latter honouring, even defending from and disciplining his sons who had referred to the young man as a wicked Gandhāra and an upstart from a distant Southern country of little repute – was attempting, in effect, to persuade Puruṣottama to surrender to the barbarian Greeks who were soon expected to stage an invasion of his prosperous country.<br>“An opportune moment?” the king pressed. “Like Takṣaśilā, that bent for the Persians for one hundred and eighty-eight years before deciding to strike back? Must I also live another one hundred and eighty-eight years to see my kingdom freed again, under your counsel?”<br>Generations prior, on the orders from the Heir of Saṃkarṣaṇa, several ancient lines of Vṛṣṇis had fled Mathura to settle and cultivate new tracts should their homeland fall to Magadhi imperialism (as it did) – among these lines were the Abhisaras who conquered the mountainous regions in and around Kaśmīra – the Satvatas and the Andhakas who ruled as Southern viceroys of the imperium at Ujjain – a house of the Ārjunāyanas in their republic in Indraprastha – the line of Samba (not to be confused with Samba, the last and traitorous Heir of Saṃkarṣaṇa) who conquered the rugged Western Sindh (as opposed to less rugged Eastern Sindh ruled by the Mūṣikas of Southern origin), and finally the line of the two feuding cousins settled on the two banks of the Candrabhāga rivers.<br>King Puruṣottama, who belonged to that latter dynasty, had, wielding in battle the banner of Vāsudeva, conquered the Uśīnara country (the region between the Vitástā and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Candrabhāga rivers) and built a prosperous country in that tract, and he had single-handedly fended off Persian incursions, preventing them from crossing the Vitástā river and seizing so much as two thirds of an inch of his land. He could not fathom – indeed, he was quite enraged at the suggestion – why that very Professor Cāṇakya who had overthrown Persian rule in Gandhāra and elsewhere, was apparently of the belief that these barbarians were somehow different.<br>Cāṇakya ignored the comment, as if offended that the king had not listened more closely to something. “You do realize,” he continued, “That your territory is in a precarious state, trapped between two enemies?”<br>This was for what Puruṣottama had cast off all historical enmities with the Gandhāras – the traitorous, unrighteous Gandhāras – the descendants of the wicked Śakuni – placing his best faith in the wisdom of Professor Cāṇakya? To hear these traitorous words?!<br>There was a rumour, that King Puruṣottama had heard from his wife – that years prior, Cāṇakya had developed affections for a Greek studentess at Takṣaśilā, even admitting her to his gurukula without the necessary qualifications and having his lectures specially transcribed to her in writing – and that her words of affection for him, in the Greek language, were repeated to this day by a parrot on the premises of the university.<br>Puruṣottama had chastised her for contributing to the proliferation of such foolish and irrelevant gossip.<br>“One of these enemies is your king,” Puruṣottama shot back. “Is this what this meeting is, Professor? A veiled threat? Is that all that Takṣaśilā’s foreign policy is – to surrender to any barbarian who wishes to seize it?”<br>“And the same is true of the entire region of Punjab and Sindh,” Cāṇakya continued, “Trapped between the Magadhas and the Persians, now the Greeks – and were these two powers to ally, we would be faced by war on both fronts, should we not seek the protection of one of these empires. Our disunity is only an impediment to co-ordination.”<br>Puruṣottama froze.<br>The consideration the interests of the civilized world as a whole, rather than merely his kingdom; the thought of a unified empire to rule the Punjab and Sindh – these were daydreams that had often occupied Puruṣottama, daydreams that he had dismissed as being precisely such. It was jarring to hear Professor Cāṇakya – a man he revered, despite their current differences – speak of (or hint to) such ideas, even if not explicitly or coherently; it touched the king’s mind on some deep level.<br>He shook it off, recalling what his minister Viśālākṣa had warned him about, based on his experience debating with Professor Cāṇakya: the Professor was incredibly persuasive, not necessarily because he was true, but because he would infer – from your intellect, personality, actions, conversations – your truest and most unspoken thoughts and desires, and make arguments that he knew you could not reject without feeling disappointment in yourself.<br>“The same was true when faced against the Persians,” the king pointed out, “And yet you defeated them, and yet Magadha has not made any Westward incursions. So what if their army outnumbers ours, Professor? So be it, each one of our soldiers will slay ten of theirs!”<br>Cāṇakya’s brief subsequent silence caused Puruṣottama to briefly wonder – then shed off the absurd and wishful thought – if he had finally defeated the invincible Cāṇakya in debate, but then he spoke:<br>“Great King – hope is not a strategy. Merely a slogan used by fools to manipulate other fools. Everything you suggest – fighting on two fronts, fighting armies larger than one’s own – requires strategy. Especially when Alexander himself is no ordinary commander. He is creative.”<br>The Persians had fielded far larger forces against his one, and yet he had won, time and again, through superior strategy and a more courageous army. To hear the Professor speak in such high terms of the Greeks – like a traitor might to demoralize – incited fury in him, and he said so in as many words.<br>“If you truly believed your own arguments,” the king said bitterly, “You would not be urging me to surrender, but rather offering me your advice in military strategy against the Greeks.”<br>“And that is precisely what I am doing,” Cāṇakya responded evenly. “You can defeat the Greeks, with my advice – I believe this. The important condition in that sentence being – with my advice. A frontal immediate war, on the Greeks’ terms, is not my advice. You must learn to lose a battle to win a war; this is my advice. Send me a pigeon if you wish to hear more of it.”<br>porus<br><br><br>
When a king of poor resources is attacked by a powerful enemy, he should surrender himself together with his sons to the enemy and live like a reed (in the midst of a current of water).
Bhāradvāja says that he who surrenders himself to the strong, bows down before Indra (the god of rain).
But Viśālākṣa says that a weak king should rather fight with all his resources, for bravery destroys all troubles; fighting is the natural duty of a kṣatriya, no matter whether he achieves victory or sustains defeat in battle.
No, says Kauṭilya: he who bows down to all like a crab on the riverbank lives in despair; whoever goes with his small army to fight perishes like a man attempting to cross the sea without a boat. Hence, a weak king should either seek the protection of a powerful king or maintain himself in an impregnable fort.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 12.1:1-9
<br>“Oh great conqueror,” the Iranian girl pleaded, “You are unmatched in your strategic acumen and your conquests, but do believe me when I say that I understand the pulse of my people.”<br>“Why should I spare my enemies in victory, Roxana? It would be foolish of me to even ask – would they have done me the same favour, had I been defeated? – for such a scenario would never have manifested in the first place.”<br>“They are mercenaries, my lord – they are loyal to whoever pays them, and for a sufficient price they will swear not to consider any competing offer. To execute them would be akin to executing the craftsmen who made your enemies’ swords.”<br>“Loyalty?” asked the young man. “Their leader deserted them as soon as my victory became obvious to him!”<br>“Śaśigupta is not of my country, my Lord – he is an Indian. But he alone is capable of leading this corporation, and all its other members have all the noble qualities of us Iranians, which you so admire.”<br>“In truth, I do not know why I bother to entertain you in my quarters. This is not your place—”<br>“Please, my lord, my word is true—”<br>“—What are your motives for protecting them? What is your stake in this?”<br>Rukhsana was nervous. It would not do at all to have her husband know that she was being blackmailed by her former lover, and that that was whom she was pleading him to spare.<br>“I am a princess of Bāhlīka, and do not wish that harm be done to my people. But I am also your wife, and thus I would never lie to you, my Lord. Thus, I have made no attempt to protect those members of my family who I believed may conspire against you – I even used my connections with them to extort that information for you, so you could be certain. I care not for Śaśigupta himself, only his followers – when I tell you to spare him, it is out of my concern for you, that I believe he will serve you well.”<br>In truth, Alexander was not sure why he had been considering a mass-execution at all – it was as if it had been dropped in drunken conversation and he had taken it as fact. It had always been his practice to execute only the leaders of his enemies, rather than massacre every peasant who had taken arms against him.<br>“Śaśigupta has offered to show me the hidden treasures of Bāhlīka, if I promise to spare him,” the Greek king said at last. “Those which the members of your family took poison to avoid divulging. If he does follow through on this, that shall demonstrate both his competence, in uncovering such secrets, and his future loyalty to me, for he will not have taken these treasures for himself. If he does not, then I will execute him. That is my word.”]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/3/3.2.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/3/3.2.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 14:20:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[3.3]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>elephant_beauty<br><br><br>
Indian women are of great modesty and cannot be seduced; they only yield themselves to men who gift them elephants; and the this is not regarded as a disgrace among the Indians, but rather it seems honourable for a woman to have her beauty valued at an elephant.
—Arrian, Anabasis Alexandri: Book VIII (Indica)
<br>[date:-326|magadha,x]<br>(After thirty-nine days of her staring longingly at the Southern Horizon, well past midnight, came the sound of hooves from the South – and as the horse came into view, its rider, in distinctly Indian garb. Her motions became scattered as the visitor approached, her breaths became ragged and her mind raced with too many matters to address.)<br>Ghṛtācī had never met him, nor had she viewed his face – indeed, she did she even know his name, and yet thoughts of him had haunted her mind for eight whole years.<br>Beware your friends, princess.<br>Beware your friends and family.<br>(She scrambled towards the palace door in a manner that most certainly did not befit a princess, removing the latches herself, expecting that he would be expecting her to do so. Why, she had nearly called for dazzling decorations to the palace and town in wait of him, only to realize that it was forbidden by his demand for secrecy, and so performed the beautifications only on herself.)<br>Even for the outrage that she had expressed upon receiving that message – indignantly admonishing the messenger from the Anonymous Postal Service of the Northern Highway, for surely the honour of a man who would send a message could not suffice for them – dismissed such talk as an attempt to turn her against her own family and towards treason …<br>(“Greetings, Ārya,” she said to him.)<br>(The unmistakable accent of a Takṣaśilā boy, a sharpness in the Indian language that was matched only by their steel … )<br>(“Greetings, Princess.”)<br>Even so.<br>Every incident that had unfurled since, she had only viewed through his eyes – spoken in such cynical words as he would in her place – thinking, at each step: “What would HE say? What would HE do?” – even as she told herself that the things he said were terrible, and she should not emulate him, there was his perpetual voice in her head, telling her at each piece of news she heard: I warned you thus—<br>When the Bāhlīkas had seized back for themselves, the country she had known as her home since she was born, forcing her family to seek refuge with her sister – I WARNED YOU THUS.<br>(—she could barely glean his image in the chamber’s dim lighting, and she was glad he could not glean her expressions. She did not wish it be let known to him, how weak she was, how much lesser confidence she possessed in herself than he apparently had in her—)<br>When her sister had treated her family with complete hospitability, denying her any cause to demand a kingdom for herself, guaranteeing, in fact, that even if she was somehow to reconquer her lost country back from the Bāhlīkas, she would rule, at best, as a vassal of her sister – I WARNED YOU THUS.<br>When her entire family, excluding herself and her sister, had been massacred by the Greeks, who had seized both Bāhlīka, her old home, and Kamboja, her sister’s realm – I WARNED YOU THUS.<br>(“I do not know who you are, Ārya, nor what you want. And whatever it may be that you want, you have found me in my darkest time, and I do not know what you think I have to offer you.” And then, thinking that he may appreciate an acceptance of personal responsibility, she added: “I do not know what you may be expecting of me, but in truth, I have done nothing despite your warnings, your advice … ”)<br>Even though there had been no further communication from him, she lived as though under his constant judgement, and yet – his message had been a call to action, and she had not acted, in eight whole years – making, at each opportunity, self-righteous excuses for her laziness and incompetence, not quite resigned in her mind to a fate of insignificance, but in an indefinite state of procrastination.<br>(He seemed neither troubled, not unconcerned, by her words. It was not that he did not find them relevant, or that he did not expect anything from her – but rather that whatever her faults had been, however deteriorated the situation may appear, he could just handle it, like a traveller who unbothered by a war on the Northern Highway as if he possessed the knowledge of a hundred other roads, and even a capacity to pave his own – like whatever news she could have delivered him, he could make good use of the situation.)<br>So she had expected, without ever forming that thought in her mind explicitly, that she had disappointed him.<br>So when after eight whole years, she had heard from him again – still identifying himself only as an Ārya of Gandhāra – it was as if all the dullness and tragedy of the past years had been washed away with his one message – like there was hope in the world again – like he had granted her one last chance, in her darkest of times.<br>(“On the board of chess,” he said gently, “One piece does not despair because his advance was halted by meeting another – for he knows, that elsewhere on the board, the other pieces of his colour are making advances, and his time will soon come.”)<br>I shall meet with you soon, princess.<br>I request complete secrecy.<br>For this reason, I cannot even reveal the exact time to you.<br>You are to wait for me in your palace.<br>The same Gandhāra.<br>(“I must observe, O Ārya, that you compared me to the piece of least value in that game. Is that truly what you see me as?”)<br>She did not know who he was.<br>She did not know why, or how, she expected him to miraculously solve all of her problems.<br>She did not even know if this was all just a cruel prank to have her wait another eight years – or forever.<br>(“Is it not more important, O Princess, that we are pieces of the same colour, you and I?”)<br>(Were they, really?)<br>But he spoke with conviction – or at least his voice in her head did – and his presence – which she had never actually been in – carried with it a confidence: and she knew, just so naturally knew, that as long as she was on his side, all would be well.<br>… she had waited, for thirty-nine days now, every day, from dawn to dusk …<br>… staring off at the Southern horizon, even after the Sun had set …<br>… trying to catch a glimpse of every visitor, as a young child eagerly waited to greet its parents from the hunt …<br>… doing nothing else, in fact: putting all her hopes on the ridiculous possibility that this stranger who had only sent her cryptic messages would come as a messiah …<br>(“In truth, Ārya,” she said softly, “It would honour me even to be merely a piece on your board. Even if this is really your ambition, your war, and you are only tricking me, you would honour me by merely taking me as your queen once you have succeeded in your war.” WHAT had possessed her to say that – nothing could be more unbecoming of nobility than to say that, nothing more devoid of self-respect … she had the mad urge to murder him on the spot only so no one ever found out about this, her future and prophecy and all be damned, but then again he seemed too mysterious, too important, to tell people about such things, or to even care, perhaps he hadn’t even noticed—)<br>Wondering for so long till just now: who would he be?<br>In initial years from receiving his message, she had tried to imagine who he might be. She thought he might have been another prince of Takṣaśilā, a rival of Prince Sanjaya – and as Sanjaya had taken her sister’s alliance, he similarly sought to take hers — it was common practice among Takṣaśilā boys to take girls of Matsyaka nobility as their brides, even referring to her people as the “land of women” …<br>(But then suddenly she could perceive a much clearer impression of his face, as he had grabbed her wrist — perhaps to jolt her out of her thoughts, or out of passion — no, not for her, no, but for something.)<br>But her imagination of him had soon transcended simple archetypes like “prince” or “strategist” or “sorcerer” – he had began to represent, for her, something far greater: a symbol of all that could be in her life, and her saviour from what dark depths she could descend into if left to her own terms – regardless of whatever form he chose to present himself to her as.<br>(“Now is not the time to think about ends, Princess,” he told her. “A good soldier does not, in the moment of battle, fantasize about the spoils of war – his thoughts are on the battle alone, with all its blood and gore and effort.”)<br>It was silly. It was ridiculous.<br>(Telling her not to fantasize about the future had the opposite effect on her thoughts. But somehow, in some attempt to divert attention from the topic, she managed to say: “I do not even know your name.”)<br>She did not even trust him. And yet even the thought of being manipulated by him gave some meaning to her life, and was better than a life of insignificance.<br>(“You may call me Kautilya,” he stated. “And while there is much that I will ask you to do, in future, what I want you to do, for now, is to act as an enemy to Śaśigupta and Alexander.”)<br>indian_archer<br><br><br>
Nothing can stand against an arrow shot by an Indian archer, neither shield nor breastplate nor any strong armour.

<br>Pabbata was trapped.<br>There was nothing he could say in protest to the Professor – Cāṇakya had done exactly as he had promised: he had sent Pabbata to campaign in Magadha, and Candragupta to campaign on the Western end of the Northern Highway. But while Pabbata had accepted this as a means to eliminate Candragupta’s competition by sending him far away, it now appeared to him that somehow, the real war was in the North-West, and that he was the one who had been sent away to Magadha.<br>What made matters worse – the tasks that Cāṇakya had assigned Pabbata were obviously preliminary actions – sabotaging some forts, seizing revenues from some captured tracts, planting and testing some agents, raiding some treasuries, causing some chaos in the country – to a future real war. He supposed that if he were to question Cāṇakya on this matter, he would be lectured on the importance of planning and strategy.<br>Plausible deniability, the Professor had said. That was the trick to the art of double-crossing.<br>Pabbata could not help but realize that his own trust in Cāṇakya’s loyalties grew the closer he was to him, and waned the further – Cāṇakya himself would have probably deemed this to be an irrationality of the prince, but Pabbata could not quite figure out which one of those proclivities it was that was contrary to reason.<br>Such was Cāṇakya’s trap, that it had made Pabbata completely reliant on him – by openly declaring war against his father, Pabbata had made an enemy out of the most powerful empire in the world, protection from which simply required a mind like Cāṇakya’s; and to abandon Cāṇakya here would only cause him to perish like a man attempting to cross the sea without a boat.<br>Sighing, Pabbata continued his very possibly fruitless task of planting explosives in the fort.<br>scheme_3<br><br><br>
When the enemy is desirous of taking possession of the territory of the conqueror’s friend, then the conqueror may, under the pretence of compliance, supply the enemy with army. Then, having entered into a secret concert with the friend, the conqueror may pretend to be under troubles and allow himself to be attacked by the enemy combined with the neglected friend. Then, hemmed from two sides, the enemy may be killed or captured alive to distribute his territory among the conqueror and his friend.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 13.3
<br>scheme_4<br><br><br>
The conqueror may tell his enemy: “A chief with a powerful army means to offend us, so let us combine and put him down; you may take possession of his treasury or territory.” When the enemy agrees to the proposal and comes out honoured by the conqueror, he may be slain in a tumult or in an open battle with the chief (in concert with the conqueror).
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 13.3
<br>2.8_death<br><br>Years ago, Vāsudeva had argued with Saṃkarṣaṇa about the nature of the order he had instituted – argued that he was bureaucratizing the problem rather than solving it; that they could simply assassinate Ajātaśatru rather than create an organization to fight the Magadhas for generations. It was not Saṃkarṣaṇa who had humbled Vāsudeva, but Ajātaśatru himself: for each plot of Vāsudeva’s was matched by an diabolical counter-play by Ajātaśatru, and that had made him quite less fond of the simplistic solutions he had thought of earlier.<br>So when Ajātaśatru had invited him to a private audience with him in a barren tract, Vāsudeva had immediately identified that the purpose of the meeting was to have the other assassinated, and demanded that the battle be a game of wits: neither party would be allowed to bring weapons, and each would be surrounded by their most trusted friends, to avoid frivolous and obvious games like replacing one’s opponent’s guards with traitors or bribing such guards to do one’s bidding.<br>Ajātaśatru’s interest had been piqued, and he had brought along with himself his son and some wicked ministers who shared his goals.<br>Vāsudeva had brought with himself some trusted advisors and classmates who shared his goals.<br>“So you are the famed Krishna,” Ajātaśatru commented, “Vāsudeva Krishna. I must say I am impressed by how you have fought against me. We are very similar minds, you and I – are we not?”<br>“A mind is defined not only by its intellect,” said Vāsudeva, “But also by its morality.”<br>Ajātaśatru was fully naked, and his chest hair was dry and sticky, stained brown with blood, but nothing that posed a security threat – he had earlier excused his appearance by stating that he had just mauled a palm-reader who had foolishly approached him and insulted his intelligence by requesting royal funding.<br>“Morality, religion … I expected better of you, Krishna. You must know that I have very little respect for such ideas.”<br>When Vāsudeva did not respond, Ajātaśatru continued:<br>“Years ago, in the midst of my war against the Licchavis, when I had conquered only part of their country, I was approached by a band of celebrating monks, who told me they were very pleased with the outcomes of my conquest. Ordinarily, I would have beheaded them on the spot for the pathetic attempt at flattery, but I did not have my sword with me at the time – for I had been too occupied blinding a child after I had just violated his mother before his eyes – and so I entertained them.<br>“They told me that they were celebrating, because their master had predicted my victory – for I was more righteous than the Licchavi king was, and I surrounded myself with better and wiser company than he did. Ordinarily, I would have not cared more than to remind my minister to execute this master and all his disciples. But I was bored, for the Licchavis were not worthy opponents as you have been, and decided to pay this master a visit.<br>“And I told him: O Wise One, I have lost the war against the Licchavis. What do you recommend I do? And he replied: Indeed, this is just as I predicted – for the Licchavi king is more righteous than you, and he surrounds himself with better and wiser company than you do.<br>“So I told him: my life has descended into tragedy, O Wise One! My kingdom is running out of wealth, my wife has left me as a result of my wicked ways, I am no longer able to find my daily quota of idiots for hunting. And he replied: embrace my religion, and all your problems will be solved.<br>“I told him: I lied. My kingdom will never run out of wealth, as I can seize as much as I want from those I vanquish in battle, my wives cannot leave me as they are imprisoned, and I will never run out of idiots to murder, there are far too many of them. And I was enraged – I am always enraged when I am lied to – and so instead of murdering him, I beat him senseless until he could not speak complete sentences, then locked him with a parrot that had only been exposed to damaged lunatics; and then after a year of him re-learning language from this parrot, I returned him to his disciples.<br>“He had been driven so insane, he blabbered such utterly meaningless words to his disciples – I thought there was no means by which he would ever be taken seriously again. I was interested to find if the disciples would abandon him or continue to care for him for what he had once been, if they would dismiss and ostracize their former master or if they would curse me for subjecting him to such a state. Imagine my shock: when the disciples immediately started worshipping him as their master again – referring to him still as the Wise One – described his change in manner while in Magadha not as insanity, but as enlightenment!<br>“He said such idiotic things as: desire is the cause of all suffering! That life is suffering! Why, for them, it ought to be! And they created fabulous tales of his miracles – and when these tales reached the people, they went to him requesting that he perform for miracles for them – and when he was unable to perform them, his disciples shamed those who had pleaded his help, and created fabulous rationalizations for his inability to help them! And that was when I knew – how depraved the religious truly are – for they will believe and worship any man who dons a simple attire and lives as a hermit. I ask: how am I more wicked than this master? For I murdered my wife, while he left his to rot; I laughed at funerals, while he told people to not mourn. Not cursed – I am celebrated by his followers now as a hero for my role in helping their master reach enlightenment!<br>“I have heard: the worshippers of Brahma are unable to obtain knowledge, the worshippers of Viṣṇu are unable to obtain wealth, and the worshippers of Shiva are unable to obtain strength – should I then simply choose not to worship any of these gods, if they are only hurdles in my path – should it not be my responsibility to overthrow such gods and seize the universe for myself? O, what a wolf can do, in a world of sheep!”<br>But Vāsudeva cut off his long-time rival, nearly ignoring the entire monologue:<br>“I suspect that you are intelligent enough to simulate in your head my argument against you – just as I am intelligent enough to simulate yours in mine. But that is not why we are here – no, not to debate religion.”<br>“Indeed,” said Ajātaśatru. “We should cut out the pretences: we are here to assassinate each other with our wits.”<br>“Not quite,” said Vāsudeva.<br>“No?”<br>“If that were the objective, neither of us would have had cause to meet in person and risk mutual destruction. No – do make another guess at my objective. If we are truly of alike mind, then you should be able to discover it.”<br>Ajātaśatru pondered this challenge.<br>“If you are of like mind to me,” he said at last, “Then you will bring a proposal that you believe to benefit both our goals. I cannot think of such a proposal.”<br>“Your goal is the demonstration of what a wolf can do in a world of sheep,” said Vāsudeva, “What is my goal?”<br>“Some religious insanity.”<br>“The propagation of the light of the Vedas and the prosperous civilization that it has created. Do you see any contradiction between these goals?”<br>Ajātaśatru hummed, thinking.<br>“There isn’t,” said Vāsudeva simply. “I see you. Every instinct in your body tells you to behead me on the spot – but you have no sword. You fume – but it is because you know I am right.”<br>“Do you truly think that conforming to the words of some dead old Brāhmaṇas is a wolf’s behaviour?”<br>“O, what a wolf can do in a world of sheep,” Vāsudeva mimicked, “What, Great King? What can a wolf do in a world of sheep? A great deal of wicked – or a great deal of good—”<br>“What’s the difference?”<br>“If there is truly no difference, then why have you consistently chosen wicked over good? It can be no coincidence.”<br>It was not common for Ajātaśatru to be silenced – he was much too intelligent to be defeated in argument, and it was a great blow to his ego to have this done in the presence of all those closest to him – but whatever shred of sanity was left in him, that hadn’t disappeared over the course of his chaotic reign, managed to surface to acknowledge Krishna as his intellectual equal, as someone worthy of arguing against – at least so long as he did not engage in any specific moralizing.<br>“So many of your actions,” Vāsudeva continued, “So much of your personality does not follow from your professed goal, even though you pretend it is. What goal does it follow from? Not demonstrating what a wolf can do in a world of sheep – no – but demonstrating that you ARE a wolf in a world of sheep.”<br>“Are you calling me a pretender?”<br>“It is not a wolf’s behaviour to conform for the purpose of conforming – and it is not a wolf’s behaviour to rebel for the purpose of rebelling – for in making an explicit effort to act in a way contrary to the words of these dead old Brāhmaṇas you speak of, you have made yourself a slave to their word, for every action you take you must first recall their word, and ensure that it is contrary to it.”<br>“Very well. I will do what I want. I still do not see what your proposal is.”<br>“I propose that you make me the heir to the throne of Pāṭaliputra.”<br>“ … ”<br>“Father,” said Udayin, “You are not truly considering this proposal, are you?”<br>“ … ”<br>“ … Father?”<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>Udayin stood over his father’s lifeless body – his right hand grasping onto the needle that his most trusted attendant had advised him to tie into his hair during the meeting with Krishna.<br>“O,” he drawled, “What a wolf can accomplish, in a world of sheep.”<br>For once, he understood exactly what Krishna’s play had been – in demanding that they both attend surrounded by their most trusted associates, he had created an advantage for himself, for that was simply the level of trust his associates enjoyed in him – unlike Father’s associates ever had.<br><br>krsna<br><br><br>

 <br><br>The Mālava princess watched with awe and pride at what she had been able to achieve – almost single-handedly, if you discounted the force that a demand from Cāṇakya had, or the pressure of an apparently unstoppable barbarian invasion at the gates – something that had not been seen even by her great-grandfather in his hundred well-lived years.<br>A joint assembly between the three great republican confederacies of the Southern Punjab! And nobody had even been murdered yet!<br>She had gone door to door, in her city as well as in the capitals of the Kśūdrakas and Śivis, begging every representative to agree to show up to the forum, refusing to take no for an answer, coming with every persuasive argument she could, herself playing, mentally, the part of Cāṇakya –<br>“Great Ārya, whatever you may think of me and my people – you must admit that you would not allow your daughter to spend a day in our city, and yet here I am, taking every risk to my personal safety in travelling to this city that would like nothing more than to see my lifeless bloody body. Despise me all you want – do not dishonour my courage as a kṣatriya woman!”<br>“So be it, then. If we shall not meet at the forum, we shall meet in the afterlife after having been massacred by the Greeks. Not in heaven, but in hell – for abdicating our duty to our people as kṣatriyas.”<br>“If none of you come to receive the Kśūdrakas and Śivis at our capital, so be it – I will ask Professor Cāṇakya to host it at the Kśūdraka capital instead, and I will go there alone on behalf of the Mālavas, if even my bodyguards desert me.”<br>And then painstakingly organized the forum and public security for all attending parties (knowing that some representatives would deliberately arrive without bodyguards, each with the hope that he’d be killed and a war would be sparked with him as a martyr), with key attention to detail to look out for any miscreants and troublemakers seeking to ignite conflict.<br>Now, with all in order, and Cāṇakya’s address in progress, she hoped she would finally have the time to wipe the sweat off her brow.<br>Dream on! Reality spat in her face, and perhaps for the first time ever, presented Cāṇakya with his match – a force unconquerable even to the power of his words – the rivalry of the Sauvīra tribes!<br>“Join hands! Join hands with those barbarous Kśūdrakas and Śivis, who murdered our noble forefathers and forced suicide upon their wives!”<br>“Join hands! Join hands with the wicked Mālavas, the tyrants who oppressed us for a hundred years, ravaging our lands and seizing our cattle to enrich their own capital city!”<br>“Join hands! Join hands with the wicked Mālavas and the lowly Śivis—”<br>“You know,” Cāṇakya interjected forcefully, “I am only asking that you unite in the same fervour against the Greeks that you are against me.”<br>The courtroom erupted, and she struggled to regain order.<br>Then she had an idea.<br>“Professor Cāṇakya,” she pressed in a concerned tone. “Your theories about statecraft may be true in the ideal. But our three countries have a strained history, and some of us see it as tone-deaf, or even offensive, to ask us to simply set this aside, to build bridges without even for a goal of such importance as repelling the Greeks.”<br>She got some nods in agreement. Cāṇakya eyed her carefully, and she held her breath, hoping he wasn’t annoyed at her.<br>“Justice can never be applied to tribes, only to individuals,” he said, “And history is never the judge of justice, for both ends of justice: deterrence and restitution, disappear with the passage of time.”<br>Before anyone else could speak in reply, Puṣkaradhāriṇī herself filled in the part of the opponent.<br>(in some corner of her mind, she marvelled at the respect and authority she had gained among all three countries – earned of the obvious and genuine effort she had put into this project, with no visible benefit to herself, and surprisingly she had lost no honour from all the grovelling she had done)<br>“But what of our wounds?” she asked. “Or, on behalf of the Kśūdrakas and Śivis, theirs?”<br>“A wound is healed with medication and rest, not by yelling in rage at the cause of that wound – and certainly not by suicide, which is what would be the result of not uniting against the Greeks.”<br>She wanted to cry at him: Please – please just say something these people want to hear!<br>The crowd erupted in chatter, and this time she cautiously allowed it, to measure the prevailing sentiment.<br>“And what of our Kṣatriya honour?” cried one at him, “something that you, a Gandhāra, would have no understanding of!”<br>“Those who forfeit their caste duty for their caste honour,” Cāṇakya replied steadily, “Will be obliged to neither, as they can be assumed to have forfeited their caste itself.”<br>“And what of our duty toward the dead!”<br>“Is not to send them company.”<br>The crowd chattered again, in less hysterical tones this time.<br>“I believe,” she said at last, interrupting them after a much longer duration this time. “That it is not kṣatriya duty to debate philosophy with Professor Cāṇakya. But I do know, that if we do not swallow our prides and banish hesitation and suspicion from the co-ordination of our efforts, then we will surely have disappointed those very forefathers we claim to fight for, by allowing their lineages to perish from the Earth.”<br>law_2<br><br><br>
My preceptor holds that quarrels or assaults of a remote date shall not be complained of.
No, says Kautilya: there shall be no acquittal for an offender.
My preceptor thinks that he who is the first to complain of a quarrel wins, in as much as it is pain that drives one to law.
No, says Kautilya; whichever is lodged first, it is the evidence of witnesses that must be relied on.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 13.3
<br>Her brothers had teased her, for all the work she had put into setting up the forum, that she was truly doing it all out of her adulation of Cāṇakya.<br>It was completely false, of course. Her adulation of Cāṇakya, of what were already his many accomplishments and obvious future glory, had no influence on her interest in the task, and nor did the fantasy of wedding him. Still, even though none of that had been relevant to her actions, the fact that she was walking by his side, in the liminal lights just past sunset, speaking so freely of strategy and all matters of intrigue, gave her a rush.<br>“You were weak today,” she said in a light, teasing tone. “You should never make those you are trying to win over feel that you are trying to convince them.”<br>In the past she would never have had so much as the thought to criticize someone as learned as Cāṇakya on any matter of strategy, but now having done things herself, she no longer felt so disconnected from the “ways things work” – she felt a sense of ability to partake in them herself, to truly learn, to talk with him intelligibly.<br>Cāṇakya hummed thoughtfully. “Indeed. One rarely persuades his opponent in debate, at least not outside of elite Brāhmaṇa circles. One convinces the undecided audience. And in a spontaneous debate, where you have the freedom to choose how the desired object of persuasion perceives the way in which he is persuaded. So instead, one should act as you did – as the mediator between conflicting sides, appearing to decide at the end, forgoing your apparent neutrality and centrism because some option is so atrocious.”<br>The princess nodded, somewhat pleased with herself.<br>Then Cāṇakya smiled. “This is not a thought that escaped me, Mālavika,” he explained. “But not every posture is available to one at every time. I had summoned the forum for an obvious purpose, and any pretence of neutrality would have appeared both disingenuous and weak. So instead I chose the opposite approach: declare a more extreme position than your actual one, or declare your position in a way that elicits outrage, so that all the arguments they develop only pertain to these sources of outrage not central to your position – then you need only to retreat from these things that cause outrage, only to arrange circumstances in a way that makes it possible for them to concede without losing face.”<br>“But you didn’t,” she pointed out, puzzled, “You didn’t try to help them save face.”<br>“No,” he admitted. “I left that part to you.”<br>She couldn’t believe this man. “You just expected me to say the things I did? What if I didn’t!”<br>“Well, you had shown great competence in arranging the forum beforehand. For a novice, anyway.”<br>“W— For a NOV—” she regarded him dryly for a moment, and he laughed.<br>“I always have multiple alternate plans, of course,” he explained. “So that at least one of them is usually successful.”<br>“So you have been using other princesses as well?” she teased, “How many – one for each country?”<br>“Princesses, princes, demented old Chandalas … from where I stand, you all look the same to me.”<br>She laughed. It was often easy to overlook, she thought, with respected men – that this respect was held by other people towards them; they themselves still held the ridiculous boyish playfulness, it did not simply fade with adulthood, and was perhaps in fact even the cause of their competence.<br>“I must ask, though, Professor,” she continued smoothly, “I know you answered the question in court, but I must ask for your true, uncensored explanation: why is it that you pushed so hard for King Puruṣottama to surrender to the Greeks, yet wish for our three countries to fight them?”<br>Cāṇakya raised a single eyebrow. “I assume,” he said, smiling a little, “That it was your father who put you up to press me on this?”<br>She opened her mouth to object, shocked – but then stopped herself. He could have feigned innocence of her intentions and simply given her a suitable answer, but he had instead chosen to take the riskier approach, to build genuine trust – and it would be dishonourable of her to not reciprocate his honesty. So she nodded, her face red, returning in slight his conspiratorial expression.<br>“It is a fallacy,” he explained, “To conflate military strategy with ideology. There is no ideology that compels you to fight every war, and no ideology that compels you to surrender each time. There is no ideology called aggressiveness, and no ideology called surrender. These are options taken strategically, based on the probability of success and the desirability of each outcome.”<br>“You did not answer my question,” she pointed out. “What is the difference in goals between the cause of our independence and that of King Puruṣottama’s?”<br>“There is none,” Cāṇakya answered, confusing her further. “But it is also a fallacy to mistake the battle for the war.”<br>Puṣkaradhāriṇī’s heart sank to hear such words. She wanted to believe, really wanted to believe, that Cāṇakya’s intents were wholly pure – that all the silly rumours of him in fact being a spy for the Greeks were just that, to suppress that sick instinct she had, that she was just some silly girl being manipulated by him towards some wicked end.<br>“So it is true,” she said a little spitefully, trying not to harden. “That you have some agenda of your own. That you are not helping us out of generosity alone.”<br>Cāṇakya’s expression was stern. “To condemn a man merely because he has an agenda is akin to condemning a merchant for making a profit. The progress of the world is derived entirely from men pursuing their agendas, for without an agenda, a man is as aimless a beast. The question, princess, is not if I have an agenda, but if that agenda is good – if it is in alignment with the profit of others.”<br>In fact, she had herself expressed a very similar view earlier when a courtier had questioned, in conversation with her father, that if Cāṇakya was such a fearsome intellect to face, if it was so frightening that they did not know what his true motives were – why not simply dismiss him? Or: if the fear was that he may then support the enemy, why not just execute him?” To which Puṣkaradhāriṇī had intercepted, masking as best as she could her disgust at especially that latter suggestion, that if one were offered the Pāśupatāstra from Lord Rudra, it would hardly be wise to refuse it on the argument that it is untrustworthy and might backfire – and it would certainly not be wise to destroy something so divine and valuable!<br>She stopped in her tracks to face him, and putting as much force and emotion into her voice as she could manage, asked: “Cāṇakya, I am not so foolish as to betray you out of the fear of being betrayed. For such is the mistrust that could be sowed by the enemies – this much I have learned from the debates I have attended in my visits to Takṣaśilā … ” —for a second, she realized that she had only really learned this from him, and even that could be a conspiracy of his, to emphasize this possibility in her mind and others’, causing an instinctive flinch away from her instinct to distrust him — why, oh why, could things not just be simple with this man, why couldn’t she just trust him, so she could do as he told without hesitation— “But I am truly, truly afraid that in all this, I might be playing the part of the foolish girl, manipulated into bringing the downfall of her own people. Is there no assurance you can deliver me? Can you not just … tell me your goals?”<br>Cāṇakya’s eyes were soft, but Puṣkaradhāriṇī could tell from them that he would not give her the security she wished for.<br>“There is much that I must disclose to you,” he said, “After the war.”<br>She could feel her pulse in her face.<br>“After defeating the Greeks?” she asked hopefully.<br>“After the war.”<br>hostage<br><br><br>
Peace, dependent upon honesty or oath is immutable both in this and the next world. It is for this world only that a security or an hostage is required for strengthening the agreement. Honest kings of old made their agreement of peace with this declaration: We have joined in peace.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 7.17:5-6
<br>The atmosphere in the Uśīnara country was festive as always.<br>It was rather standard, in the countries of Punjab excluding Takṣaśilā, for people to spontaneously break into dance – as a display of either some joy or machismo, almost as if it were a natural language of the people of the region. And today too, several mass dances had been held across the city, to maintain city spirits, and also to entertain the city’s new Greek visitors.<br>Drunken roadside brawls had always been commonplace in the city, with either weapons or with bricks, pots and other commercial articles, and today, too, there was an army parade, to the inspection of the Greeks – and Great King Puruṣottama and Great King Alexander had just exchanged wines, and they had complimented each other’s with great gusto.<br>The residents of Uśīnara could hardly find a difference in the colourful, boisterous city they loved.<br>The court session was all smiles, of course, for the occasion was a joyous one. Some inattentive courtiers who dozed off were cheerfully awakened by their helpful neighbours, and all spoke highly of the new-formed friendship between Puruṣottama and Alexander, and of the courtly statesmanship that both rulers had displayed in their interactions and in their joint decision to form this alliance.<br>The gathered courtiers stared inquisitively at their Greek visitors.<br>“Why does he show his thighs so openly?” whispered one.<br>“Perhaps the Greeks, being barbarians, have not mastered the art of wrapping garments?” another suggested.<br>“No, silly, that is an _apsara!” (was another proposition) “But her hair is white – she is surely too old to still be dancing and entertaining us with her skills, but perhaps financial circumstances—”<br>“Fool! That is not a woman – that is Alexander! The Greeks have white hair even in their youth.”<br>“That is not true – I have met a Greek before, he did not have such an odd appearance.”<br>“Indeed – the males among the Greeks cut their hair short – this must be a woman!”<br>“No, they don’t! If they cut their hair short, how would they survive a blow to the head?”<br>“Well, obviously, their brains are located in their thighs!”<br>“But their thighs are exposed too!”<br>Alexander would have been quite annoyed, if he had understood the language.<br>“King of Macedon. Autocrat of Greece. Pharaoh of Egypt. King of Persia. Lord of Asia. A greater hero than such as Heracles, a greater conqueror than such as Dionysus and Cyrus, may he reign for longer even than King Minos did – Alexander, son of Zeus!”<br>Cheers.<br>Lots of cheers.<br>The courtroom was full. Bustling, even.<br>vyuha<br><br><br>
Chapter summary: Army arrays – staff, snake, circle, detached order; counter-arrays
According to Brihaspati, an array is comprised of the front and reserve, two wings, and two flanks. The principal arrays – staff, snake, circle, detached order – are varieties of the above two forms consisting of wings, flanks and front.
Stationing the army so as to stand abreast, is called a Staff array.
Stationing the army in a line so that one may follow the other, is called a Snake array.
Stationing the army so as to face all the directions, is called a Circle array.
Detached arrangement of the army into small independent units is called a Detached Order array.
A Staff array has equal strength on its wings, flanks and front.
It is called a Breaking-the-enemy-array array when its flanks are made to project in front.
It is called a Firm array when its wings and flanks are stretched back.
It is called an Irresistible array when its wings are lengthened.
It is called an Eagle array when, having formed the wings, the front is made to bulge out.
The reverse-form arrangements of the four arrays above are respectively called a Bow, a Centre of a bow, a Hold, and a Stronghold array.
It is called a Victory array when the wings are arrayed like a bow.
It is called a Conqueror array when the front is projected.
It is called a Big Ear array when its flanks and wings are formed like a staff.
It is called a Vast Victory array when its front made twice as strong as a Conqueror array.
It is called an Army-Face array when it has its wings stretched forward.
The reverse-form arrangement of an Army-Face array is called a Fish-Face array.
It is called a Pin array when one constituent of the army is made to stand behind the other.
A Pin array comprised of two lines or four lines is known as an Aggregate or Invincible array respectively.
These are the varieties of the Staff array.
A Snake array has its wings and front capable of turning.
It is called a Serpentine or Cow-urine array when its wings, flank and front are of unequal depth.
It is called a Cart array when it consists of two lines in front and has its wings arranged as in the staff-like array.
The reverse-form arrangement of a Cart array is called a Crocodile array.
A Cart array consisting of elephants, horses and chariots is called a Swift World Conquest array.
These are the varieties of the Snake array.
A Circle array’s varieties are the All-auspicious, One-of-eight-divisions and Victory arrays.
A Detached order array has its wings, flanks and front stationed apart.
It is called a Diamond or Alligator array when five divisions of the army are arranged in detached order.
It is called a Park or Crow’s foot array when four divisions of the army are arranged in detached order.
It is called a Half-moon or Crab array when three divisions of the army are arranged in detached order.
These are the varieties of the array in detached order.
An array is called Auspicious if its chariots form the front, elephants the wings, and horses the rear.
An array is called Immovable If infantry, cavalry, chariots and elephants stand one behind the other.
An array is called Invincible if elephants, horses, chariots and infantry stand in order one behind the other.
Of these, the conqueror should assail the Breaking-the-enemy-array array with the Firm array, the Firm array with the Irresistible array, the Eagle array with the Bow array, the Hold Array with the Stronghold array, the Victory array with the Conqueror array, the Big Ear array with the Vast Victory array, the Swift World Conquest array with the All-auspicious array, and all kinds of arrays with the Invincible array.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 10.6:1-43
<br>The proceedings of the courtroom were interrupted by the sound of its heavy wooden doors swinging open – a smooth, rolling sound, as the hinges had recently been oiled in invitation to the Greeks – and all heads in the courtroom spun around at the source of the noise, jolted by the sudden influx of ventilation.<br>“Great King Puruṣottama.”<br>Standing in the doorway – illuminated only by lightning and distant moonlight – was the silhouette of a young Brāhmaṇa, untied hair and dhoti waving in the warm monsoon winds, and he was identified by the frozen courtiers from that silhouette alone, if not by the furious expression that revealed itself as he strode further.<br>“Professor Cāṇakya,” the chief minister Viśālākṣa addressed the guest with mixed respect and fear, and acutely aware that this was reflected in his tone.<br>In one curt gesture, Cāṇakya emptied the courtroom of all the visitors he did not wish to meet at that time – and they gladly and frantically scurried away, abandoning whatever activity it was that they had been doing – and glad that at least the Greeks were not present during this particular window, for they were sure that Cāṇakya would have quite literally consumed them all in the flames of his tongue as Hanuman had in Lanka.<br>“I suppose,” the Professor commented. “That the people of the Punjab outside of Gandhāra need no cause for celebration.”<br>“Honoured Professor,” the minister replied, offended, “There is much cause for celebration. Our kingdom’s territory has been doubled under Greek overlordship – why, even Alexander was impressed by the Great King’s bravery—”<br>Puruṣottama was increasingly embarrassed with each word of Viśālākṣa’s – for he had an objection to each one of them, but could not voice them, either due to complications with preserving his honour, or due to political considerations that restrained his tongue – and he was interrupted by Cāṇakya, who said:<br>“I am glad to see, Minister, that you are not too upset by your kingdom’s humiliation in battle – or over the lives of your dead soldiers.”<br>The slight offense that the minister had earlier taken escalated into positive outrage.<br>“Professor! You cannot possibly fault the king for this loss – Alexander’s army was twice the size of his!”<br>“Alexander’s army was twice the size of yours, and yet, knowing this, you marched your soldiers to their death! In a battle whose result was known to you from the start – even as you denied this result, in hope of absurd miracles – even as I taught you that hope is not a valid strategy, but a slogan used by pompous fools to manipulate other fools, you played the part of both such fools.<br>“Your humiliation is not your loss itself – but the foolishness that lead to it. My admonishment is not of your strength, but of your intellect and of your poor valuation of your peoples’ lives and wealth. You may celebrate that Alexander happened to be impressed by your valour and has treated you kindly after defeating you in battle, just as a gambler may celebrate his unlikely win – such tales of winning against the odds make for good tales for plays and poetry, but they are not guides on decision-making.”<br>Viśālākṣa was silent.<br>The horrible truth was this: Cāṇakya’s words were not too different in meaning from those he had given in warning before the war, they were only ruder now than before; the Greeks had not acted in any way that would have been out of expectation; yet, his words hit far harder now they had than before. It was as if, to forget the pains of defeat, the Vṛṣṇis had taken to sensual pleasures, and Cāṇakya was the resurgence of that bitterness in the mind that they had attempted to mask.<br>“Forgive me,” said King Puruṣottama at last. “Forgive me, Professor, for not hearing your advice – for casting doubt on your motives. You did, in fact, tell us so.”<br>But Cāṇakya held up a hand, and said: “Very well. Those are matters of the past. What matters now is this: what have you learned from this battle? What have either of you learned?”<br>When both listeners were silent, Cāṇakya continued. “Their formations are exceedingly simple. A phalanx of spearmen, with some cavalry to flank. Yet they possess one great advantage that is almost sufficient to explain their victory over yours. Do you know what this is, Minister?”<br>The king and minister opened their mouths to make some cliché suggestions – but Cāṇakya ignored them and continued:<br>“Much of the theory of battle without losses has simply to do with range. This is why swords have advantage over knives; why archery has advantage over swords; and why horse archers have even more advantage. It is why catapults are preferred over siege engines or elephants in tearing down walls.”<br>“Do you suggest that we switch to spear-centred melee forces?” Viśālākṣa questioned.<br>But Cāṇakya shook his head. “In the civilized world, we use swords for their flexibility against light infantry – but with people like the Greeks who spend vast resources to recruit primarily heavy infantry, that is ineffective. But it is not the case that the most effective counter-play to a particular weapon is that weapon itself. The question, then, is: what is the optimal counter-weapon to a long spear?”<br>Despite that he had just earlier chastised them without regard for title or power, the king and minister watched Cāṇakya in silent admiration, as he thought and strategized aloud, something that he almost never did for concern for secrecy (and this should have alarmed them that Cāṇakya had some further hidden agenda behind his actions, but they found themselves overwhelmed by his charisma and persuasiveness).<br>“Perhaps some kind of defensive mechanism against spearpoint … of course it would be childish to expect an offensive weapon that simply combines the range of long spears with the flexible movements and attack of a sword … Minister!”<br>“Tell me, Professor.”<br>“Give me your staff, the royal scale, and a whip.”<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>A short while later, Puruṣottama found the fabrics of his throne shredded, and Cāṇakya was seated atop it.<br>“Indeed,” said the Professor, “The flexible nature of a whip allows it an even greater range of motion as a sword of equal weight with equal effort, while maintaining the longitudinal range of a spear or greater. Do you see what I am saying, Minister?”<br>Two heads shook. The minister asked skeptically: “Do you suggest that we use whips in battle, Professor?”<br>Cāṇakya looked annoyed. “There is a certain steel produced by the Draviḍas in the Southern extreme of the world,” he said, “Which is known to metallurgists everywhere as the finest in the world. And although this property is not one that is of common use at present, this steel can be expertly molded to form flexible blades in the shape of whips.”<br>“What do you want of us, Professor?” asked the king.<br>“I request your permission to build a wing of the University of Takṣaśilā in your kingdom,” Cāṇakya announced to a shocked duo audience. “To teach the manufacture and use of this type of sword. Alexander will be suspicious if Takṣaśilā were to start expanding its military so soon – but for you, Puruṣottama, with your vanquished army, it is only natural for you to begin rebuilding your army—”<br>“Professor—”<br>“—What we need, King, is a fighting force that is unfamiliar to the Greeks, and therefore cannot be exploited by them, and we must build that fighting force under their very noses. Your country is the natural choice for this.”<br>“You wish for me to enter into an alliance with Gandhāra?” asked the king, “To forget the traitorous past of your people, the descendants of the wicked Śakuni, their spineless submission to the Persians for centuries!”<br>“Yes.”<br>Puruṣottama considered this proposal with deep suspicion. He did not consider himself a grudgeful man who would allow petty enmities to compromise grander goals, like the preservation of the culture of the Āryas and the Vedic way from Greek incursions – never in his stable reign had he made a decision contrary to the honour and well-being of his people.<br>Yet, an alliance with Takṣaśilā was precisely what Alexander had been coercing him into, and Cāṇakya’s insistence on an identical agenda on opposite grounds – under the argument that it would weaken the Greeks – was a cause for distrust, a cause to believe that this might be a ploy by Alexander, either to force him to do his bidding, or to test his loyalty, or both. There was cause to resist changes for their own sake – and that cause was to avoid being manipulated into the destruction of one’s own self and line, one’s elements of sovereignty, as Professor Cāṇakya might have called it.<br>And yet the fruit offered by Cāṇakya – even as the offer was unspoken – was too sweet to refuse so simply.<br>(The king did not announce the decision until an animated back-and-forth with the minister, during which Cāṇakya sat patiently on the Uśīnara throne.)<br>“Very well, Professor,” announced Puruṣottama, “I will admit the alliance under some acceptable terms. But I have one condition.”<br>“Do tell, Great King.”<br>“I have a daughter, Yaśomatī, who has attained marriageable age—”<br>“—certainly, I could arrange for her marriage to the crown prince of Takṣaśilā—”<br>“No, Professor,” Puruṣottama politely interjected. “I wish to give her in marriage, to you.”<br>marriage<br><br><br>
Marriage precedes the other calls of life. 

<br>The giving in marriage of a maiden well-adorned is called Brahma marriage.
<br>The joint-performance of sacred duties by a man and a woman is known as Prājāpatya marriage.
<br>The giving in marriage of a maiden for a couple of cows is called Arśa marriage.
<br>The giving in marriage of a maiden to an officiating priest in a sacrifice is called Daiva marriage.
<br>The voluntary union of a maiden with her lover is called Gandharva marriage.
<br>Giving a maiden after receiving plenty of wealth is termed Asura marriage.
<br>The abduction of a maiden is called Rākṣasa marriage.
<br>The abduction of a maiden while she is asleep and in intoxication is called Paiśāca marraige.

Of these, the first four are ancestral customs of old and are valid on their being approved of by the father.
The rest (Arśa, Asura) are to be sanctioned by both the father and the mother, for:

<br>It is they that receive the price paid by the bridegroom for their daughter.
<br>In case of the absence by death of either the father or the mother, the survivor will receive the price.
<br>If both of them are dead, the maiden herself shall receive it.

Any kind of marriage is approvable if it pleases all those who are concerned in it.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 3.2:1-13
<br>“There is grave news from Śaśigupta,” said the messenger, immediately seizing Alexander’s attention.<br>After defeating the Aśvakāyanas, the tribe of Queen Kṛpā, who controlled the strategic fort of Avarana – and her ally Prince Sanjaya, who controlled the great city of Puṣkalāvatī, Alexander had appointed Śaśigupta there as satrap, for he had demonstrated his overwhelming efficacy previously in Bāhlīka, reducing local rebellious chiefs and disruptive tribes there and restoring order.<br>With his army heavily wounded after the battle with King Puruṣottama, the last thing Alexander wanted to hear was bad news from a country that controlled his only supply line back to the West, right when he needed to call in reinforcements.<br>“What is it?” he asked.<br>“He reports that his country, and indeed the entire region of the Indian Caucasus, has been attacked by a certain Ghṛtācī, the sister of Kṛpā, and his people have rebelled in her favour. O King of Kings … Nicanor has been slain.”<br>“Well?” asked Alexander, “What has Śaśigupta done?”<br>“He has apparently surrendered, O King of Kings. His precise words were: my army has deserted me. I have been told that I have been spared so far on account of all that I have done for them before, but that I too will be slain, should I continue to co-operate with the Greeks. I fear, O King of Kings, that we have lost control of the entire territory … ”<br>indian_cavalry<br><br><br>
Their horsemen have two javelins, like lances, and a small shield smaller than the infantry’s shields. The horses have no saddles, nor do they use Greek bits nor any like the Celtic bits. Instead, around the end of the horses’ mouths they have an untanned stitched rein fitted with fitted bronze or iron spikes (but somewhat blunted) on the inside. The rich people have ivory spikes. Within the mouth of the horses is a bit, like a spit, with reins attached at both ends. Then, when they tighten the reins, this bit controls the horse and the spikes attached to it prick the horse and force it to follow the rein.

<br>Cāṇakya!<br>After all those years, of hearing her father complain jealously about the prosperity of the Gandhāras, cursing them as the wicked, traitorous Śakunis.<br>It was common among girls to whisper, among themselves, that they would only ever marry a boy educated at Takṣaśilā – never in public, of course, should their fantasies offend their real future suitors in – to be infatuated with these Takṣaśilā boys, who ruled the courtyards of the university, bullying each other in aggressive debate, who were the best in all they did, who were told, at their very initiations: Familiarize yourselves with one another, because it is you all, seated in this hall today, who will be ruling the world eighteen years from now.<br>And now her attendant had just told her, on half a half-hour’s notice, to beautify and present herself at the royal court, as she was to wed Cāṇakya – that mysterious young upstart, the Śakuni among those Śakunis!<br>Her heart racing, Yaśomatī lifted the veil, opened her eyes, and finding Cāṇakya’s far stoicer ones, carefully moderated her own expression to match his.<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>“Ārya,” she said in a voice soft and feminine, “It is an honour to meet you.”<br>Cāṇakya nodded simply. “It is. But I have no fondness for flattery, and there is much of importance that we must speak about.”<br>The princess was petrified.<br>“Many maidens have romantic daydreams about their wedding and subsequent marital life,” said the Professor. “Are you afflicted with such a disorder?”<br>“ … ”<br>women<br><br><br>

<br>“What have you done, Professor!”<br>King Āmbhi had listened.<br>When Cāṇakya had stated his bizarre plan to cause his own prince to rebel against him, King Āmbhi had listened; when Cāṇakya had instructed him to send risky letters to the Persians, King Āmbhi had listened; when Cāṇakya had requested that he agreed to share the liberated Kamboja territory with a certain Queen Kṛpā, he had listened; when Cāṇakya had advised an unconditional surrender to the Greeks, King Āmbhi had listened, and when Cāṇakya had asked him to ignore certain anti-Greek activities underway in his country, King Āmbhi had listened.<br>But to be asked to join hands in friendship with Puruṣottama – Gandhāra’s rival for generations – was simply audacious.<br>“Professor Cāṇakya. My family and his have a historic enmity. What have you done?”<br>“Removed that historic rivalry,” stated Cāṇakya.<br>“Because it was an impediment to your plans?”<br>“Yes. And once I am through with my plans, both you and King Puruṣottama will be great beneficiaries.”<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>“… what are your plans, Professor?”<br>“Revealing my plans carelessly will not help me advance them. But you are an honest and competent man, as is King Puruṣottama, and I do not betray my word to honest and competent men. I request you to trust my intellect.”<br>meroes<br><br><br>
Alexander kept on sending others in succession; and last of all Meroes (Maurya) an Indian, because he ascertained that he was an old friend of Porus.

<br>Giving a regal acknowledgement to the announcement of his epithets by his bards and beaming at his two greatest Indian allies – Āmbhi and Puruṣottama – the Greek king announced:<br>“This is a historic moment indeed – the union of two ancient enemies in alliance, defying the prophecies of advisors and seers alike, a feat that could be achieved by none but the son of Zeus!”<br>Despite his great outwardly pronouncements, the conqueror of the world  <br>But even the great Alexander – who possessed so many accomplishments to his name – felt the slightest pang of insecurity, for he had heard rumour, that the alliance he had wished to take credit for was not truly his work, but that of a certain mysterious Maurya. Who was this Maurya – what were his motivations – and what means did he use for such persuasion? Certainly, Puruṣottama and Āmbhi swore that they had not spoken to any such Maurya, and that they were entering this alliance by their own volition – and these stories about Maurya (it was a seal, apparently? – bearing the icon of the peacock, that bird Alexander had learned of in Babylon – and the word itself meant “of the peacock”?) and the nature of his intervention were so vague and miraculous, it hardly appeared sane for Alexander to give it care, as god-fearing as he was.<br>And then, far more pressing, <br>Somewhere far removed from the site where this alliance was being forged, another alliance – more sacred and more eternal, yet linked to this one – underwent officiation.<br>In this barren stretch, with the Chief Minister of Puruṣottama’s as the only guest so as to maintain secrecy from the rest of the world – a man and a woman, Cāṇakya and Yaśomatī, circumambulated the holy fire.<br>wedding<br><br><br>
You learned people assembled at this sacred ceremony know it for certain that we two hereby accept each other as companions for life and agree to live together most cordially as husband and wife. May the hearts of us both be blended and beat in unison. May we love each other like the very breath of our lives. As the all-pervading God sustains the universe, so may we sustain each other. As a Professor loves his student, so may we love each other steadfastly and faithfully.
Distant though we were, one from the other, we stand now united. May we be of one mind and spirit! Through the grace of God, may the eyes radiate benevolence. Be thou my shield. May thou have a cheerful heart and a smiling face. May thou be a true devotee of God and mother of heroes. May thou have at heart the welfare of all living beings!

 <br><br>[date:-325|magadha,x]<br>The gathered crowd of Mālavas silently parted to clear a way for the revered Professor.<br>His stoic eyes fell upon the lifeless body of his beloved.<br>His cold, stoic eyes.<br>“Has Alexander claimed victory yet?” he asked.<br>The Mālava Chief nodded.<br>“Good.”<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>“The war has taken a far greater toll on us than on the Śivis and Kśūdrakas, Professor,” said the Mālava Chief Minister. “The barbarians slew vast numbers of men – civilians, all, in the countryside – forced vast numbers of our women to sacrifice their lives to Agni to escape their perverted hands – and the children have been taken as slaves. All to lure us out of our fortified city. But we held our ground, as you asked, and your plan was executed.”<br>In any unforeseen circumstance, he had said, Should I be unable to reconvene with the Mālava capital, then you shall act as my representative and execute my plan.<br>Yes, Lord, Princess Puṣkaradhāriṇī had replied simply.<br>There were some scholars, including Cāṇakya’s own preceptor Caṇin, who maintained that only some feelings were valid: those that stemmed from sattva (goodness) and rajas (greatness) were valid, while those that stemmed from tamas (wicked) were invalid. Kindness was always valid; fury never so – ambition was valid so long as it was towards a sattvic goal.<br>Neti Kautilyah. A feeling was made valid or invalid by the validity or invalidity of the action that it encouraged in its bearer. To make a country prosperous, it was necessary to love it – to avoid death, it was necessary to hate it – and to destroy an enemy, it was necessary to hate him.<br>(Such were the depravity of the times, the aged cried, that vast numbers of civilians, without regard for their caste, wealth or learning, had been used as negotiating tokens. Such were the depravity of the times, that women had been left no choice but to self-immolate to preserve their dignity.)<br>Conversely, generic depression was not a valid feeling; nor was complaining about the times; nor was hatred towards a good man; nor was aversion towards the rich for being miserly; nor was lust for another man’s wife and wealth.<br>(He mustered every spark of hatred, every feeling of revulsion, that he had ever faced toward anyone – toward the wicked Greeks who had murdered Puṣkaradhāriṇī, toward Dhanānanda and the Magadhi monarchs before him, toward the Persians – which now felt like such a long time ago – toward all those who refused to just shut up and listen to him – mustered all the kind emotions he had ever felt – for his mother, for Professor Caṇin, for his students, for the women who had loved him, for all those who adored and worshipped him – and cast away the positive emotions, and directed his hatred against the barbarians led by Alexander.)<br>“She died bravely,” said the Chief, the grieving father. “Bow in hand, slaying barbarian after barbarian until her very last breath.”<br>There would be a time to exchange ideas and to trade with the Greeks, to entertain them as partners and friends, as immigrants and as hosts for traders and monks, to hire them as mercenaries and to compliment their strengths as one customarily did to a defeated enemy, as Rama had done to Ravana after defeating him. And then it would no longer be valid to hate them.<br>There is much that I must disclose to you, he had said. After the war.<br>That time was not now.<br>Now was the time for war.<br>hostage_2<br><br><br>

<br>Such lies! Such lies, that his enemies propagated – enemies on the inside! <br>Those who pretend to be friends of Alexander, and yet are jealous of his success.<br>To believe that the heroic Alexander – the demigod Alexander – the great besieger, who destroyed the mighty empire of the Persians, who defeated the fearsome Assakenoi (Aśvakāyanas) in battle, who obtained the submission of Takṣaśilā, the most prosperous city known to the Greeks, who defeated the mighty Porus (Puruṣottama) with his many elephants and then vanquished those enemies whom Porus himself was previously unable to defeat – could meet his match in the hands of a loosely confederated, lionskin-wearing barbarian tribe like the Śivis and the Oxydraci (Kśūdrakas) – or indeed, by any mortals at all!<br>It can only be attributed to foolishness or malice to claim so.<br>Here, then, is the truth, as Alexander recounts to Nearchus and other chroniclers who have accompanied him.<br>As the Macedonian army sailed down the Candrabhāga river, I learned that the kings who ruled by the banks of that river had retreated to strong forts out of their fear of me. But as much as the son of Zeus is inclined towards mercy, he took this action as a rejection of his sovereignty – for all former vassals of the Persian empire were to submit to me, that had been my command – and so I began to harass the countries of these enemies to draw them out of their forts.<br>Nearchus says: And this is when, of course, we received news that Nicanor, the Satrap of the Paropamisadae (Kamboja) had been slain?<br>Indeed – this was when we received the communication from Śaśigupta, informing us that the Aspaisoi (Aśvakas) rebelled, led by a certain wicked Scythian princess, an Amazon by the name of Ghṛtācī, interrupting our supplies and murdering our reinforcements. Nicanor had been slain, and the cowardly Śaśigupta, receiving an ultimatum from Queen Ghṛtācī, had also deserted me – and even King Āmbhi of Takṣaśilā woefully informed me that all his forces were occupied fighting the opportunistic nuisance that were the Abhiras of Kashmir. It was a trying time indeed!<br>Nearchus says: Is this why you retreated from attacking the Śivis? Was it here that you realized that by attacking the Oxydraci directly, you will be able to reconvene with your territory in Arachosia and Gedrosia and secure a Southern supply line to Babylon?<br>Retreated? Nonsense! I swiftly made contact with Phillipos, who began campaigning to eliminate the Aspaisoi menace. Sure, the war certainly made the supply of reinforcements from the North more expensive, but it was not an impossibility – nothing is, for the son of Zeus! In view of the objectives of war, I recognized that the objective of my war against the Śivis was to prevent them from aiding the Malloi (Mālavas) further South, who were the enemies of true importance, who ruled over the most prosperous Indian city apart from Takṣaśilā.<br>Why didn’t I secure the Southern supply line? As mentioned, the problems in the North were not of such great importance that I needed to reorient the entire purpose of my Indian campaign as its consequence. Should I bother, in the course of my grand campaign, to weed out every criminal and miscreant who lives among the barbarians – as are the lion-clad Śivis of no influence, or the loosely confederated Oxydraci? Or should I focus on besieging those impenetrable forts, scaling those unscalable heights, conquering those countries that even my godly half-brother Dionysus was unable to conquer? Of course, it is the latter course that a heroic name like mine chooses.<br>(Alexander had approached the Kśūdrakas with a mighty confidence – with his soldiers and closest confidantes singing such praises that he had never lost a battle, that he was invincible, and had such a record to show for it! But on setting foot on Kśūdraka territory, his army had been plagued by such troubles – poisonous plants, traps, bandits, fires, skirmishing horse-archers – each village they slaughtered would have, with discipline, poisoned their food and water making them of no use to the invading army.<br>Thus forced to treat the peasants with kindness, Alexander was left with no negotiating chips against the Kśūdrakas. At this point, Alexander was fearful of breaking his streak of victories that his army had so praised, and desperately wished to abandon the mission against the Kśūdrakas – but was also fearful of causing his army to lose faith in him, and desperately needed a win.<br>But he was also aware – for he was no stranger to the cautionary Attic tragedies – that desperation drove men to make impulsive choices, choices that lead to disasters of such magnitude as to undo the great gains they may have previously made.<br>And in a move that surprised even Cāṇakya, as well as himself – for they had both apparently overestimated Alexander’s ambitiousness and perfectionist thoroughness – Alexander declared that the objective of the campaign against the Kśūdrakas had always been to isolate them in their city while he launched a sudden surprise attack on the Mālavas, his real rivals.)<br>Nearchus says: I must say – I had been confused by your actions against these tribes, but all the pieces truly came together in your invasion of the Malloi.<br>Indeed! The Malloi – the prosperous Malloi with their great city; this time, having learned the strategy of the Indians and being determined to win – as I always have … of course – I rushed my cavalry into the Mālava country before word could reach the defenders, surrounded their capital, and rampaged through the country for a full-scale conquest.<br>Nearchus says: And one by one, each layer of their defence fell. Taken by surprise, large parts of their army had been outside the fortress and unprepared, and they fell to your cavalry. Then your infantry arrived, and surrounded the city – and then, of course, the elephants that had previously been seized from Porus.<br>Careful, now! We did not seize those elephants – Porus is a friend of mine, and it was in this capacity that he sent his elephants to serve me. But yes – terrified by the sight of Porus’s elephants, the Malloi quit defending their city walls, and retreated to their citadel, where we pursued them.<br>Nearchus says: And that was where you were wounded – by that stray arrow!<br>An arrow is nothing, Nearchus. There was nothing more heartening to see than my men charge the walls of the citadel in teutonic fury – both to pursue the archer who had shot me, and to hunt down the Malloi at large and massacre them. To know the regard with which my men hold me, even after all these years – to hear their guttural roars, to see the devotion in the eyes of even those who had previously mutinied against me!<br>Nearchus says: But once they entered the citadel—<br>They slew the Malloi and enslaved the women.<br>(They found the citadel almost empty, except for those defenders who had already been slain.)<br>Nearchus says: But—<br>And the children too! Yes, they were also enslaved.<br>(A clicking sound. And then the entire citadel collapsed onto itself, killing the invading Greeks instantly.)<br>Nearchus says: But actually—<br>That’s all that happened, Nearchus. That is all that happened. It was a great victory for us.<br>

But for the education I have given you, your fee will not be monetary.”<br>Candragupta kneeled. “Name your price, Professor.”<br>Cāṇakya turned to face his student and dearest friend.<br>“Entire Bhāratavarṣa.”]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/3/3.5.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/3/3.5.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 14:20:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[3.6]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>“I am asking you to defeat not one, but two great empires, each the largest to have existed in their respective realms, neither of which have lost half an inch of territory in the entire history of their existence.”<br>Candragupta stared at his Professor.<br>“But how, Professor?” he asked genuinely. “You have taught that a country that shares long contiguous borders with enemies on both sides lives perpetually in a fundamentally untenable position – even if we successfully unify the kingdoms of Sindh and the Punjab, that is precisely the situation in which we find ourselves, and you propose we fight a war on both fronts, defeating both the Magadhas and the Greeks? How, Professor?”<br>A distorted image of the fireplace’s sparks appeared as reflections in Cāṇakya’s eyes as he stoked the embers of its dimming light.<br>“We will exploit their strengths and use them against each other,” he said, “Then swoop in to seize victory.”<br>Candragupta intently pored over the map that he had been asked to retrieve.<br>“Are you not worried, Professor, that inviting the Greeks to fight Magadha will introduce a new source of chaos into what is already a mess of a situation?”<br>Cāṇakya fanned the smoke.<br>“The Greeks are not strong enough to invade Magadha successfully – of this, I am certain,” said Cāṇakya. Then he continued: “There is a great deal of respect that I have possessed, over the years, for Alexander. From what I have learned from merchants who frequent the West, he brought to many of Persia’s Western provinces a splendid culture of learning and thought, great improvements in infrastructure, urbanization and trade, he honours the sciences and possesses a great strategic acumen.”<br>“Professor … ?”<br>“And yet this supposedly honourable ruler has, upon crossing the Hindu Kush mountains, committed brutal atrocities against innocent civilians. Why so? Destroying the Sauvīrāyana University of the Mūṣikas did Alexander no benefit – yet he put the entire city to the sword, murdering the men, enslaving the children and forcing suicide upon the women. Why?”<br>Candragupta thought for a while, then recalled an old lesson of Cāṇakya’s:<br>“Because it feels like progress. It is like attempting to cross the desert even knowing that the task requires a larger jug of water than that in one’s possession. Crossing the desert halfway does you no good – indeed, it does a great deal of harm – yet, it feels like progress.”<br>“It feels like progress, to an animalistic mind that is not capable of distinguishing between fighting and winning. And in such desperation – his inability to fathom that this country is unconquerable to him – even the most strategic minds become animalistic, resorting to fighting rather than winning. Even as Alexander claims he stopped at the Vipāśa river because of his army’s mutiny, he knows this cannot be true, as his army would have been equally reluctant to continue South – no, it is because he is completely aware that he is himself incapable of conquering Magadha.”<br>“And yet you believe that I can do it? You wish to instigate a war between the Greeks and Magadha that will sufficiently weaken them both for us to vanquish them both at the last moment. But if you do not believe the Greeks pose a credible threat to Magadha – do you then plan to first weaken Magadha, transmit some security information to the Greeks?”<br>“I shall do nothing of the sort, and neither will you. Weakening the strong, and strengthening the weak – causes instability – causes a state of perpetual war, and this is not what I want with the Greeks. I wish for you to one day acquire the throne of Magadha, and then I will wish for the Greeks to be in submission to you, I will not wish for you to reign over a weakened state.”<br>“You wish to have Magadha weakened now, when they are your enemies, and strong in the future, when it belongs to you? … How will you simultaneously achieve both those goals, Professor?”<br>Cāṇakya smiled.<br>The flame flared.<br>“I will play a game.”<br>scheme_5<br><br><br>
Whoever is rising in power may break the agreement of peace.
Spies previously set about to work under the enemy and attend on the hostaged prince – carpenters, artisans, other spies – dancers, actors, singers, instrument-players, buffoons, court-bards, swimmers, magicians – prostitutes and women spies under the garb of wives – with the unrestricted right to enter, stay at and leave the palace at any time, may take the prince away at night through and underground tunnel dug for the purpose – or placing him in a garb carrying or concealed under pipes, utensils vessels, clothes, beds, seats or other articles, by workers such as – cooks, confectioners, bathing servants, servants who carry conveyances, who make the bed, who make toilets, who dress, who procure water, who procure items in the dark – or he may be disguised as such a servant.
Or he may pretend to be in communion with the god Varuna in a reservoir through a tunnel at night while spies under the guise of grocers may poison the sentinels – or fire may be set to stores of commercial articles. In view of avoiding the fear of pursuit, he may place a human body in the house he occupied, set fire to it and escape by breaking open some house-joints or a window, or through a tunnel – or disguise himself as a transporter of commodities like glass beads or pots – or as an ascetic after entering the residence of one – or as a forest recluse – or as someone suffering from a peculiar disease – or as a corpse – or as a widowed wife, following a corpse being carried away – or in the midst of carts and cart-drivers – and spies disguised as forest-people should misguide pursuers by pointing in an incorrect direction.
If he is closely followed, he may lead the pursuers to an ambush, or in the absence of an ambush leave gold or morsels of poisoned food by the sides of the road and take a different road. If he is captured, he should try to win over the pursuers by conciliation and other means, or poison them, or fight them with a concealed sword and the help of sentinels and previously-concealed spies. Or the king may accuse the enemy of the prince’s murder and attack them.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 7.17:33-61
<br>sakadala_dhanananda<br><br>O Emperor Dhanānanda – Lord of the empire headed at Magadha, the greatest realm of the Earth in terms of land, population and wealth – son of the deceased former Emperor Mahāpadma, vanquisher of the Pañcālas and of various Southern Nāga tribes – the following is communicated to you in utmost urgency by your humble slave, sworn to loyalty and to your service, Prime Minister Sakadala.<br>By now, you are aware that Prince Pabbata has freed the princes of the Yaudheya, Ārjunāyana, Trigarta, Rajanya, Ushinara, Jyabaneya, Dharteya, Bharga and many other Western frontier states, who had been kept as hostage in the Pāṭaliputra Dungeons to maintain peace and to extract tribute.<br>Truth be told, I am hardly worthy of your forgiveness in allowing such a heist to take place right under your very palace.<br>I will, regardless of what punishment you deem appropriate for me, identify the traitors who perpetrated this crime and bring them to you for execution – I have already taken every individual connected to the prison system and wall security into custody for interrogation. Answers are being extracted, and I will act on them swiftly.<br>I have dispatched spies to re-capture the freed princes from the bordering states, and this shall be done swiftly.<br>In view of preventing external support to the rebellion in Magadha, I advise the immediate fortification of the Uttarapatha and other subsidiary roads near the Western frontier with 1500 elephant corps and supporting troops, with widespread organized parades and demonstrations of strength, in full view and hearing of the dwellers of important cities near the border. I further advise the deployment of spies to the bordering states to sabotage their siege equipment, to cause strife within their countries, and to liberate your nephews who have been kept hostage in their forts, in view of the fact that our peace with them has already been sabotaged.<br>
“O prince!” cried Rūpakośa, “Oh, prince Augraseniya! I do admire the courage with which you have taken this news!”<br>Augraseniya nodded, a thoughtful look on his face.<br>“Why,” continued the prostitute who had quickly become the prince’s favourite – and perhaps his most trusted friend and confidante – in the matter of mere months, “If I were in your place, O prince, which I could never be deserving of course, I would be shaking, trembling, with every possible emotion one may have – at the conspiracies being plotted against me before my very eyes!”<br>The crown prince of Magadha let out a sigh. “I have long accepted Pabbata’s betrayal, my beloved. In truth, I never quite trusted my youngest brother – no, I always found him to be lacking in loyalty, but it was only my generosity that stopped me from expressing this thought out loud!”<br>“But to find out that even the Prime Minister is jealous of your position, prince? You do not even seem shocked by this – instead, you seem to have accepted such behaviour from your court-mates as a political reality, and focused your efforts on action. I truly, truly admire your strength, O prince!”<br>Augraseniya stopped dead in his tracks. It was not the first time, at all, that Rūpakośa had dropped such a revelation, seemingly assuming that Augraseniya had already figured it out for himself, and spoken conspiratorially of the same – no, no, of course he had already thought of it for himself, he was just surprised that Rūpakośa had as well. But he should no longer be so surprised – she was obviously no ordinary prostitute – much like his grandfather had been no ordinary son of a barber – no, she was fit to be his queen!<br>“Then you can surely also see precisely what action it is that I am going to take, can’t you, Rūpakośa?”<br>(It was an attempt to fish for more information, but Augraseniya caused himself to believe that it was truly just him behaving conspiratorially with his queen.)<br>“I can certainly now see the wisdom of your earlier act – of convincing Emperor Dhanānanda to give you equal say over the deployment of military troops and over relations with neighbouring states.”<br>The prince was starting to see what Rūpakośa was saying, but was still fearful of saying it explicitly himself to check, lest he embarrass himself. So he merely hummed in response.<br>Rūpakośa shook her head in indignation. “To think the Prime Minister is conspiring with Pabbata … against you, against the Emperor!”<br>“WHAT?” (Augraseniya immediately cursed himself for giving it away, but Rūpakośa didn’t seem to suspect anything – or so he hoped, anyway.)<br>“Forgive me for saying it out loud, prince! Forgive my tactlessness. But that is the plan, isn’t it? By sending away the most elite of Magadhi troops to the Western border, the security of Magadha’s interior country will be weakened, the most crucial heartland left assailable to Pabbata! By sending spies to the neighbouring states, Magadha will gain their enmity – they may aid Pabbata in his war, or use your cousins as hostage to extract favours from their fathers who hold positions in Magadha’s government – and even if the Prime Minister is able to somehow free some of them, he will surely use them to his own advantage, against you! It is a move that accomplishes several things – I am disgusted by it, O prince!”<br>“I knew that, of course.” (Despite knowing the gravity of all that his queen had just told him, Augraseniya found himself caring more about his image in her eyes than about acting on these revelations and securing his power.) “And of course … of course that is Sakadala’s plan, because he knows what the right course of action here would be.”<br>The prince had oft-encountered, that such conspiratorial talk from him would elicit an actual underlying meaning that he hadn’t intended from Rūpakośa – no, of course he had intended, had implied it, that was the point, he just wished to test her—<br>“Of course!” his queen exclaimed, “Sakadala knows to not escalate things with the neighbouring states so far so quickly – for even as your father may be more powerful than they are, Magadha is currently plagued with problems and stands divided, and the continual presence of enemies on its borders will surely weaken it by the time you ascend its throne!” (Augraseniya nodded thoughtfully) “Surely he knows that the right strategy here would be to, say, initiate a trade war with the neighbouring kingdoms to warn them to back down … ”<br>prostitutes<br><br><br>
With a view to enhance the splendour of prostitutes holding the royal umbrella, golden pitcher, and fan, and attending upon the king seated on his royal litter, throne, or chariot, prostitutes shall be classified as of first, middle and highest rank according to their beauty and splendid jewellery; likewise their salary shall be fixed by thousands.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 2.27:4
<br>Something big was happening, Augraseniya realized.<br>When that boy Cāṇakya had arrived in Pāṭaliputra so many years ago, he hadn’t gone empty-handed – he had made friends, allies – in the Dungeons and among internal security personnel, but also among the ruling houses of Magadha. It was not only Pabbata who had freed him, but he had made one more friend, close to the throne.<br>(Of course. Sakadala was a Brāhmaṇa. There was no way that he would be content in living as a mere servant to a king, he would always wish to be master himself. That was the great mistake that Grandfather had made in appointing a Brāhmaṇa advisor in accordance with the customs of the Western realms – they were an ambitious people, power-seeking, never simply content with what they had.)<br>And so a great alliance had been forged that day, with the following agreement: the countries to the West of the empire would be conquered by Candragupta in Father’s name, while Pabbata would campaign to acquire Father’s empire itself; these two realms – the Western half, ruled by Cāṇakya and Candragupta, and the Eastern half, ruled by Sakadala and Pabbata – would, federalized, form one great empire, ruling over all Āryāvarta undivided.<br>And Augraseniya and his line would be no part of it.<br>This seemed to hardly bother Father, who seemed content as long as he could live the rest of his life with minimal discomfort – why would he care? It didn’t affect his reign after all, Pabbata would hardly commit patricide, and his line would continue regardless of who succeeded him.<br>And so Augraseniya was left to act for himself.<br>Thus he wrote, to Rūpakośa’s diction.<br>augraseniya_father<br><br>Father,<br>This is a message from your loyal son and true successor, Augraseniya.<br>I have come to realize that at its core, Pabbata’s war is against me, not against you. And it is I who must fight it.<br>In letting the offender Cāṇakya go free, you have provided Pabbata with a critical resource in his war against me: namely, the support of all our neighbouring states. Likewise, I ask that you also provide me with the resources that are rightfully mine, command over at least a portion of those resources that I am truly fighting to secure for Magadha.<br>Namely, I request final say, as well as direct command in emergencies, over the positioning of imperial troops, over spies, over trade policy and foreign relations and management of the logistics of the Northern Highway. My commands on this matter will overrule Sakadala’s opinion on every count.<br>In my first decision since assuming this command: I overrule Sakadala’s assignment of additional troops to the Western border, as well as his dispatch of spies to the Western kingdoms. I order, in place of these actions, a full ban on the transmit of all persons and items in or out of Magadhi territory. All messages or essential goods for trade will be exchanged at a heavily-guarded checkpoint on the Westernmost extreme of our territory on the Uttarapatha.<br>Furthermore, I will hereby take command of all operations started by Sakadala to identify and capture Pabbata’s spies in our midst, whether in the dungeons, in security, in any other government employment or otherwise.<br>I request your generosity in allowing me to proceed so, Father. I trust nobody but you, in this war.<br>godliness_3<br><br><br>
Astrologers and other followers of the king should infuse spirit into his army by pointing out the impregnable nature of the array of his army, his power to associate with gods, and his omniscience; and they should at the same time frighten the enemy.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 10.3:32-33
<br>“Magadha has reacted precisely as you predicted, Professor,” said the chief of the Ārjunāyanas, “First, they blocked all trade links with the Ayudhajivi states, threatening to escalate into a full war if we do not resume paying tribute and send our princes back to them as hostages. Next, we received a communication from crown prince Augraseniya, offering great rewards should we support him in crushing Pabbata.”<br>It was almost as if Cāṇakya was omniscient – and omnipotent. Vṛṣṇiman wondered if the former was a result of the latter – that Cāṇakya’s apparent omniscience was because he was, in fact, somehow the one orchestrating all that was observed. The thought made him uneasy.<br>“At the end of the day,” the dark silhouette said, “Most people don’t really do much besides follow simple protocols that occur to them without much thought. Pretend there is a split within your faction and send conflicting messages to your enemy from each side, one hardline and one sympathetic … These powerful kings like pretending the machinery their states run on is something inaccessible or incomprehensible, but one who has actually dealt with them on a very intricate level knows just how simplistic and blatantly flawed these systems often are.”<br>Six hundred kilomiles East, in Pāṭaliputra, a woman wept, disgusted at the man she laid with.<br>“Guide me, Professor,” she had said some years ago, “To my revenge on that wicked lowlife who slew my husband. As long as you will help me achieve this goal, I am yours to wield as a weapon, regardless of whatever be your ulterior motive.”<br>Faking her pleasure for the barbarian scum that was the crown prince of Magadha, she closed her eyes and recalled her husband’s image, swearing that it would never fade out of her memory. Swearing to herself: my body may now be defiled, but my soul will always belong to my husband, and my mind to Professor Cāṇakya.<br>She clutched the pendant around her wrist – the small capsule of poison – and resisted the unstoppable urge to use it.<br>Not today. Not until her goal was complete.<br>(And not on herself, of course.)<br>(A month later, Emperor Dhanānanda was found dead in his bedroom.)]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/3/3.6.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/3/3.6.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 14:20:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[3.7]]></title><description><![CDATA[

My teacher says that the seed sown in the field of another shall belong to the owner of that field. Others hold that the mother being only the receptacle for the seed, the child must belong to him from whose seed it is born. Kautilya says that it must belong to both the living parents.

I swear this to you, my beloved husband, my Lord – this is the oath of a pativrata.<br>“Speak, my Queen,” the rot said in a gentle tone. “What is it you wish to tell me?”<br>“Lord … ” stuttered Rūpakośa, making her guilt obvious in her eyes, “Your father’s killer … it wasn’t a Greek spy—”<br>(You must take the following precautions—)<br>(One, there must not be any weapons within the Crocodile’s access as you perform this task – or at least, you should have enough time and available space to make your escape before he can obtain a suitable weapon.)<br>(Two, you must have – throughout at least the past three instances that the Crocodile saw you – signalled discomfort, guilt, as well as the impression that you were attempting to fake the reverse, as well as a complete restraint over showing any enjoyment of sensual pleasures, whether genuine or faked, as well as the impression that you had been attempting to tell him something but felt unable to.)<br>(Three, at the time that you perform this task, you must NOT have sexually satisfied the Crocodile. Indeed, even in the subsequent days after you perform this task, while you may show affection to him by other means as you deem fit, you may not engage in intercourse with the Crocodile until I give the signal.)<br>(Four, if he reacts angrily after you perform this task, and you are unable to pacify him, or you are forced to flee to save your own life, you must make the appearance of avoiding him afterward, but primarily out of guilt and distaste for yourself, not predominantly anger or distaste for him. You must avoid his gaze, only occasionally making eye contact in unspoken request for sympathy to remind him of past times.)<br>“ … forgive me, O Lord! I could not stand him continually intervening in matters that were yours, sabotaging you in what was truly your war against Pabbata, refusing to protect, with all his forces, what he was effectively only taking care of until you reached maturity – I could not stand seeing you so powerless over what was rightfully yours … please forgive me, O Lord—please forgive me—I could keep a secret from anyone, O Lord—but not you—”<br>(If you take these precautions, he will surely return to you in seven days with the appearance of offering you his forgiveness and protection, and of taking you into a conspiratorial fold about the whole matter.)<br>coercion<br><br><br>
In order to separate citizens and country-people from traitors, the king should employ all the strategic means, except coercion. It is very difficult to inflict punishment on an assembly of influential men; and if inflicted at all, it may not produce the desired effect, but may give rise to undesirable consequences.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 9.6:2-4
<br>“What troubles you so, Candragupta? Speak.”<br>Candragupta stared at his Professor, who had not looked up at all from the letter he was writing to talk to him. He opened his mouth, then closed it again as he realized he was about to ask a stupid question about that, then opened it again, realizing that he was, in fact, well, not troubled, but at least puzzled by something.<br>“Professor … I find it difficult to precisely express my thoughts as a question, as it seems to me that I already know the answer to any question I might ask. But nonetheless, I see that I am confused.”<br>“If you are confused, Candragupta,” said the young man who was the same age as him, and yet apparently controlled all events that took place everywhere, “You should clearly express what it is that you expected, and what it is that happened contradicting your expectations.”<br>Candragupta considered this.<br>“I had always imagined, Professor,” he said slowly, “That the assassination of Emperor Dhanānanda would be … a significant event. It sounds silly and small to voice into words exactly what that means, but I had imagined it would come with grand speeches – about the triumph of good over evil, the pronouncement of a new era, the Ārya conquest of Magadha – I had imagined the event to become the subject of poetry, that would be sung for centuries forth, for such an unexpected event to seem profound to all.” (And he had imagined that he would have been the one to carry out the task, and be celebrated as a hero for it. Or at least be the man behind the operation, or at least to have some say in how it was carried out. The thought made him feel like a small-minded glory-seeker, and he hated himself for it.)<br>“Suppose,” said Cāṇakya, “That I – or you – went around giving such speeches now, starting celebration amongst the people, commissioning bards to write glorious poetry about you … do you think, Candragupta, that this would be a good idea?”<br>Of course not, but Candragupta took a moment to consider the implications of this anyway.<br>“Of course not,” the Professor continued, “Because you also had an almost unspoken expectation that the assassination of Dhanānanda would symbolize the end of a dark age and the beginning of your reign. But it is not. As I have taught you several times in the past, Candragupta, idealizations like Rājamaṇḍala and the game of chess do not come close to capturing the reality of war. Unlike in these games, real wars are not won simply by killing the king – for there are other powers in the kingdom, systems set in place, to take power upon loss of a king; otherwise securing power would be too easy.”<br>“The assassination of Emperor Dhanānanda was a play,” Candragupta realized, “One strategic action towards a much grander goal. But how? What does it accomplish, Professor?”<br>“A good plot accomplishes several goals,” Cāṇakya explained, “First. Shortly before the assassination, I had, through one of my spies in Pāṭaliputra, sent a fake message to Magadha’s vassal kings, the kings of the states of the Central Country, ostensibly from Emperor Dhanānanda – declaring the Greek invasion of the North-Western states to be a national security threat to Magadha and ordering the deployment of certain large numbers of troops in a pre-emptive strike against the Greeks.”<br>Candragupta’s jaw dropped. “You assassinated Dhanānanda so no one would have any way to verify the authenticity of this message? Really?”<br>There was nothing wrong with that, of course – as far as Candragupta could reason – but it was just such a surprise, to know how easy it was to assassinate the most powerful king in the world, that it could be done to accomplish just one small goal in a long game, rather than as a goal in itself.<br>Cāṇakya nodded. “And I did so framing the Greeks for the assassination, so that Sakadala – or anyone else – would immediately be seen as traitorous for turning against Dhanānanda’s order for a military offensive against the Greeks. So that even though Sakadala can see through the obvious frame job, he will be unable to object, in order to maintain appearances – indeed, even if everyone can see through the obvious frame job, they will not object, out of fear of being called traitorous by political rivals and those who wish to signal their own virtuousness.<br>“Second. By having Rūpakośa confess her crime to Augraseniya and yet go unpunished, Augraseniya now feels, deep down, to be a part of her conspiracy. He will be obliged to lie for her, to protect her, rely on her against all others whenever his position is insecure. We have, in effect, made the Magadhi Emperor our stooge.”<br>Did that not mean that they had won the war? No, Candragupta imagined Professor Cāṇakya saying, For we can hardly exercise a free hand on Magadhi government policy through this set-up – a string of decisions that serve our purposes would arouse suspicions and weaken Augraseniya’s position in the government or even cause him to be ousted or assassinated if such disaffections culminate – or it might even arouse Augraseniya’s suspicions about Rūpakośa – and it is certainly an incredibly insecure position to be governing through such a narrow string as one spy; open dominance on the government was vastly preferable.<br>“Third. By sowing distrust between the king and the prime minister, we have dealt Magadha a great loss. Court sessions will be riddled with fights – between king and minister, and between various other factions – intentions will be questioned in the open and positions of authority will be weakened, Sakadala will be unable to clamp down on such disaffections as the king will then be made suspicious that it is an attempt to consolidate power. Public life in Pāṭaliputra will have become insufferable for all – as a consequence, disaffections will spread and those who lust for the throne will rear their heads to garner support; we will be able to pit them against each other whenever we wish, or use the undermined confidence in the stability of Magadha in our own case for the throne.”<br>It was a wildly different way of thinking that Cāṇakya had, compared to a regular conqueror who lusted for a throne.<br>A regular conqueror – even if he was not so foolish as to believe that assassinating the incumbent would grant him the throne – would perform an assassination simply on the heuristic that it was a move against the reigning government (or as Cāṇakya might have said, because it gave the appearance of fighting, rather than actually help winning). And perhaps that move would be beneficial – or perhaps it wouldn’t, or would even be harmful in some unanticipated or ignored way – but the conqueror’s victory or loss would depend on such luck.<br>Not so with Cāṇakya. His plays were planned – it was as if he could calculate, in advance, that he would win – with his imagination and reasoning, even in the absence of experience – so his victory would truly be the fruit of his work.<br>It was incredible, truly. Cāṇakya was a boy born to poverty in a distant Southern country that had till recently only ever been heard of in plays and poetry, and he had worked his way up to become the most trusted advisor in the government of the ancient and most glorious kingdom of Gandhāra – indeed, the single most powerful statesman in the North-Western realms, and his ambition was much vaster still.<br>Cāṇakya would probably describe his association of their victory and grand speeches and celebration to be the distinction between ambition and ambitiousness. For even though Candragupta had adopted the Professor’s ambition, he had, in that brief thought, prioritized the social proclamations of his greatness, and the comforts it would bring, over the importance of the task whose accomplishment would actually be the cause for that greatness – and in doing so, he had erred.<br>“There is one question you must still ask, Candragupta,” said Cāṇakya, “What is my purpose in summoning the Central Country armies to fight the Greeks?”<br>The Professor had told him earlier, that the goal was to have the Magadhas and Greeks be enemies now, but allies once Candragupta ascended the throne of Magadha.<br>Candragupta had asked how that was possible.<br>The Professor had smiled.<br>And now Candragupta smiled.<br>“I needn’t ask that, Professor. I know the answer.”]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/3/3.7.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/3/3.7.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 14:20:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[3.8]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>Every lion was a god in the eyes of its prey.<br>(“It is with great sorrow that I inform you, my favored student,” Cāṇakya had written to him, “Of your father’s death—“)<br>The sole dictator of its destiny, the sole occupant of its thoughts, the source of all its emotions.<br>A single lion was worth more than a hundred hares – indeed, it was the single greatest beast to roam the jungle, in every respect.<br>(“He was found dead in his room several weeks ago, and the physicians state that the marks on his body do not belong to any poison known to them – indeed, I was also unable to find any matching descriptions at the libraries here at Takṣaśilā—“)<br>And yet a single lion was insignificant to the jungle.<br>(“Several artefacts were found scattered on your father’s body, including: dissociated wooden beads of a wood not known in the civilized world, as if from a necklace, an eagle motif, and a bronze war helmet of distinctly Greek mold—“)<br>And yet the death of a single lion meant nothing to life in the jungle.<br>Even its own pride mourned its death so briefly – immediately devolving into brawls over the questions that truly mattered: ascension and inheritance.<br>(“You should be aware that there is a large undercurrent of doubt over the official claim that the act was the work of Greek assassins. The argument is as follows. If the Greeks were to send assassins to Pāṭaliputra, they would subcontract Magadhi assassins – not foreigners who will be fragile in this environment, and unlikely to succeed. If they did send Greek assassins, they would be clad in more efficient attire, without heavy armor and certainly without distinctive Greek symbolism. And even if they did, it is highly unlikely that the only articles that separated from the assassins’ outfits in the ensuing struggle were those of obvious Greek symbolism. Instead, the doubters say that an explanation that would lead to the observations is that these artefacts were planted, in an obvious attempt to frame the Greeks—”)<br>He had never possessed any reverence for his father, Pabbata realized, and yet upon his death he naturally felt the obligation to think fondly of him.<br>He did not naturally feel that fondness itself, though.<br>He wondered if those who cried at funerals did so not out of genuine sorrow, but out of guilt at not expressing that sorrow in the manner they did.<br>(“I needn’t say why I am informing you of this conspiracy theory. Regardless, I should also warn you: if the Greeks do show interest in Magadha – DO NOT seek their alliance. You must be seen to be upholding the path of justice regardless of whether the official story or the conspiracy theory is the truth – otherwise, your enemies will simply shift to believing the opposite story to portray you as wicked and patricidal—”)<br>The more sorrow he made himself feel – and it was surprisingly easy to feel such kindness for a man who was his father, as lowly as he may have previously seen him to be – the more enraged he was at those who had slain his father. Not that they had slain him – but that they had done it so unritually, as if his father had been such an unimportant man. He was offended at how pathetic of a frame job it had – that they considered his father so unimportant that they did not even afford some thought into doing a good frame job – that they believed Magadhis wouldn’t even care enough about his father to bother contesting it.<br>Equipped with his army’s newfound sympathy, Pabbata raised his arm in salute.<br>astrology<br><br><br>
Obstructions to profit are: passion, anger, timidity, mercy, bashfulness, adopting a non-Ārya lifestyle, haughtiness, pity, desire for the afterlife, strict adherence to virtuous life, deception, neediness, envy, negligence of what is at hand, generosity, lack of faith, fear, inability to endure cold, heat, and rain, and faith in the auspiciousness of lunar days and stars.
Wealth will pass away from that childish man who inquires most after the stars; for wealth is the star for wealth; what will the stars do?
Capable men will certainly secure wealth at least after a hundred trials, and wealth is bound by wealth just as elephants are bound by counter-elephants.

<br>“The enemy is smart.” <br>Surari tentatively looked at her husband, the Prime Minister of all Magadha, who had been pacing urgently across the room for the past two-fifth-hour, eyes bloodshot and staring at a particular war helmet he had brought with him from the crime scene.<br>“The enemy?” she enquired on a relatively light note, “Are you now left with only one, my dear husband?”<br>Prime Minister Sakadala slowly shook his head. “No, Surari,” he said in a tone that was both quiet and passionate at the same time, “An enemy. Not a petty rival in court to thwart, not a distracting troublemaker who sets my plans back for some months, not a mere feature of reality like hunger, laziness or the Magadhi state that I have learned to do the best under. An enemy who possesses intelligence – who can learn my weaknesses and develop a strategy that truly handicaps me – an enemy I cannot defeat by mere fighting, but the use of deception as well. An enemy that I haven’t faced since … well, since as long my memories maintain clarity.”<br>“The Greeks?” Surari questioned, “Why, it is only an assassination. You yourself have carried out so many—”<br>“Not the Greeks!” Sakadala exclaimed, “It was not the Greeks! For anything! The whole operation was a farce, and an embarrassing&nbsp; one at that. I do not believe that Dhanānanda had ordered any offensive against the Greeks before his death either, but if I recall the decision, my enem— rivals, stupid rivals who cannot see beyond petty court politics, will accuse me of collaborating with the Greeks, why even declare my own guilt in the attack! — the vassal kings may not even listen to me, believing there to be a schism in the court, and if there is a schism in the court, you better believe I will not be the one to win it in this situation, being viewed as the establishment— and now two thirds of all imperial elephantry is marching, under no leadership whatsoever, to fight an enemy we know nothing about, for a military objective that does not even exist!”<br>“But who is the enemy, Lord? Who benefits from all this?”<br>“I do not know – in fact, it may just be the Greeks making such an obvious assassination to set about this bizarre sequence of events that will lead to a crushing military defeat for us. I have taken every possible means to try and identify any unusual or non-routine visitors to the capital at the time of the attack, interrogated them all, interrogated their alibis … nothing! I cannot imagine how some assassins could penetrate the impenetrable city of Pāṭaliputra at night, enter the palace, sneak past every guard, physically fight the ruler of the greatest empire in the world without detection, poison him, then leave past all of those very defenses!”<br>“Well, I do … ” Surari started, then stopped, chiding herself. How silly of her – that was after the attack, it would only have made her husband even angrier if she had blurted out something so irrelevant.<br>“What?”<br>“No … I was just being silly. I do know of an odd visitor to the palace, but it was after the assassination, so it is of no relevance. Silly of me.”<br>“What odd visitor?” Sakadala asked absently, anyway.<br>She shook her head. “There was … a Brāhmaṇa hypnotist from Ayodhya, who had apparently been summoned by Augraseniya for an audience. Which was odd, because usually we do not have many Brāhmaṇas entering the palace here – besides you, of course, my Lord.” (She grimaced, knowing her husband did not enjoy being reminded of his caste – as it evoked feelings of guilt in him, as if he were being treacherous to his people – even as he denied such a thought, arguing that it made little sense.)<br>But Sakadala’s eyes shot up. “A Brāhmaṇa man?” He asked “With Augraseniya? WAIT—DID YOU SAY HYPNOTIST? A HYPNOTIST WAS ALLOWED TO MEET THE EMPEROR – WITHOUT MY PERMISSION? WITHOUT MY PRESENCE? WHY WOULD … HOW WOULD … WHAT else do you know about this meeting, Surari?”<br>She stuttered – she had not been expecting that meeting to have any importance, so was taken quite by surprise.<br>“Um … I … I just thought he was seeking the advice of a seer in grief, due to his father’s death … but I was not invited to the session, because, well, you were not – I learned about it from the Emperor’s mother myself, she was present when it happened … ”<br>law_3<br><br><br>
Whether an accused is a stranger or a relative to a complainant, his defence witness shall, in the presence of the complainant, be asked as to the defendant’s country, caste, family, name, occupation, property, friends, and residence. The answers obtained shall be compared with the defendant’s own statements regarding the same. Then the defendant shall be asked as to not only the nature of the work he did during the day previous to the theft, but also the place where he spent the night till he was caught hold of. If his answers for these questions are attested to by reliable referees or witnesses, he shall be acquitted. Otherwise he shall be subjected to torture.

<br>(I will warn you so: if you are ever in the moment exactly prior to such a situation, you will find your mind having many wishful thoughts – oh, surely I would lose consciousness before they inflict any significant injury – oh, surely I can just provide false information, and they will have no way of verifying, why, the very possibility of that makes this whole process unreliable to start, and they know it – I will simply not reveal the information, and suffer any pains they may inflict on me, I know I can and will do it, because I should! – maybe they are not even going to torture me, perhaps the official executioner is only here out of his personal curiosity.)<br>“Problem!” said the Prime Minister, dressed in robes far darker than what was usual for him, “How do you bring in an anti-government propagandist, a sower of dissension, who upholds a philosophy contrary to official sanction, to meet with the Emperor and tell him lies? Any ideas?”<br>The Prime Minister’s cronies shook their heads dramatically with comically pursed lips.<br>“Well, you would disguise him as a member of an approved sect, of relatively little fame, have the Emperor issue the invitation himself – if you have enough sway over the throne. Of course, this would only work if the meeting was private, but no matter what excuse you come up with to have the Emperor make it so, he seems to have found a new air of foolish confidence in himself, saying: Oh, but knowledge should be shared! I must not keep such an auspicious audience from my friends, or from my mother!”<br>“Then what did she do, Prime Minister?” queried the official executioner with a child-like inquisitive look, tilting his head as he brought up one finger to press into his right cheek.<br>“So you take the opposite strategy: you hide the true purpose in plain sight! You make it a public scandal – a BRĀHMAṆA has entered the palace to HYPNOTIZE THE MAGADHI EMPEROR! Who caused this?! Augraseniya has been acting very sympathetic to the Brāhmaṇas, will he now adopt their laws as well – LET IT NOT BE SO! Is he already hypnotized, is he being hypnotized to order more hypnotists – is this the new, dark weapon of the Brāhmaṇas to destroy the Magadhi way of life? Was he complicit in his own father’s assassination – OH, LET THE DYNASTY OF THE GREAT MAHĀPADMA NOT BE STAINED BY THE SIN OF PATRICIDE, LET US HOPE THAT IT IS NOT TRUE! Such distractions, such drama – everyone’s ears strained to look for any dangerous calls to action and even inclinations that the hypnotist may place in the emperor’s mind – that nobody notices the random, irrelevant fact that the hypnotist told the emperor a false version of the story of Bharata and Kaikeyi, in which Bharata is not forgiven by his people even after he denounces his mother’s actions.”<br>(That is all a fantasy. If not at the moment that they drill a hole through your first fingernail, then after you are slowly, excruciatingly slowly, blinded in one eye and been impaled through your urethra by a glowing or spiked metal rod, you will reveal every single thing that they want to know from you.)<br>“Haaaaau?” exclaimed the official executioner in his annoyingly rehearsed tone, “Why did he do that? That would have certainly escaped my eyes, or indeed all but—” he gestured to Sakadala, “—the sharpest eye in Magadha.”<br>“Why would he do that? Except to plant a very deep-seated, unquestioned belief in the Emperor’s mind that should someone close to him also commit a heinous crime to benefit him, he should also keep their secret, as he would stand to lose by revealing it. Someone close to him … close enough to have persuaded him to invite this hypnotist in the first place.”<br>“Who could that be, Prime Minister?” asked the official executioner, appearing thoughtful. Then he (far more slowly than would be thought possible) spun on his heel, coming to face her, making eye contact. “Oooohhh … ”<br>“Now, young lady,” said Sakadala approaching her in rather leisure for the situation, “I know that you could not have been the originator of this plan. Nor do I believe there could be any greater goal you could be pursuing in all this. You will tell me who your sponsor is – either before, or after you are made to suffer through the punishments of hell.”<br>(I swear to you, young lady – that should you die in your mission, I – with the countless disaffected who have been wronged by Magadha – will avenge you, and will realize your dream of avenging your husband. But should you act out of such delusions of being able to withstand torture – I assure you, then, that in pursuit of a petty desire to appear more virtuous than others, you and you alone could then be held responsible for compromising our objective, and of betraying the sanctity of your devotion towards your husband.)<br>Rūpakośa bit her suicide pill.<br>And Pāṭaliputra erupted into civil war.]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/3/3.8.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/3/3.8.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 14:20:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[3.9]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>law<br><br><br>
In virtue of his power to uphold the observance of the respective duties of the four castes and of the four divisions of righteous life, and in virtue of his power to guard against the violation of Dharma, the king is the fountain of justice.
Sacred law, evidence, history, and government edicts are the four legs of Law. Of these four in order, the later supersedes the previously named.
Sacred law is eternal truth holding its sway over the world; evidence is in witnesses; history is what is found in the tradition of the people; government edicts are the orders pronounced by kings.
As the duty of a king consists in protecting his subjects with justice, its observance leads him to heaven. He who does not protect his people or upsets the social order wields his sceptre in vain. It is the sceptre and the sceptre alone which, only when exercised by the king with impartiality and in proportion to guilt either over his son or his enemy, maintains both this world and the next.
The king who administers justice in accordance with sacred law, evidence, history and edicts of kings which is the fourth will be able to conquer the whole world bounded by the four quarters.
Whenever there is disagreement between history and sacred law or between evidence and sacred law, then the matter shall be settled in accordance with sacred law. But whenever sacred law is conflict with rational law, then reason shall be held authoritative; for there the original text (on which the sacred law has been based) is not available.
Self-assertion on the part of either of the parties has often been found faulty. Examination, honesty, evidence and asseveration by oath – these alone can enable a man to win his cause.
Whenever by means of the deposition of witnesses, the statements of either of the parties are found contradictory, and whenever the cause of either of the parties is found by government spies to be false, then the decree shall be passed against that party

<br>“Read it,” the Emperor ordered, his eyes bloodshot.<br>rupakosa_augraseniya<br><br>My prince. My Lord. Forgive me, for I have lied to you, and acted as an enemy to you – consistently, repeatedly, and in more ways than you could imagine. But not in the way that you will be told I have, by the Prime Minister and his allies.<br>For months now, Prime Minister Sakadala has been hypnotizing me — to carry out all sorts of wicked plans for him. I have been aware of this hypnosis, but rendered unable to reveal it to you, that is the strength of his powers. With great willpower, I have tried, repeatedly, to give you hints, but anything explicit would refuse to escape my lips – I was bound.<br>I did not kill your father – it was Sakadala. He forced me to lie to you, so as to take suspicion off the real culprits. Who this may be, I do not know – but I know that Sakadala is complicit in it. I called the Brāhmaṇa hypnotist from Ayodhya, as I had heard that a hypnotist could reverse the effects of a previous hypnosis – but as you forbade a private audience, and I was bound from telling you why that attempt failed as well. I do not hold it against you – I would never hold anything against you, my beloved – you did not know.<br>This evening, Sakadala came to my bedroom – he gave me a poison pellet – and he gave me one last, horrible instruction: to kill you, my Lord.<br>I would like to say that my love for you would make me resist this instruction, to overcome Sakadala’s dark powers. And I do believe it would. But I cannot take that risk. I would rather die. And so, I will.<br>This is my last, and final message to you, my Lord. Your beloved Rūpakośa wishes you a long and joyful life.<br>Emperor Augraseniya was seething.<br>“Prime Minister … ” whispered his sister Durdhara, her eyes wet, “This betrayal … I used to think of you as equal to my father!”<br>Sakadala looked more insulted than anything.<br>“If I had truly hypnotized her to bind her from revealing the fact,” he said very slowly, “Then how was she able to write this letter?”<br>“Her love,” exclaimed Augraseniya indignantly, tears brimming in his eyes – “Her love for me overcame the wicked powers you wield. You must not feel so good right now – that must have been a serious blow to your pride.”<br>“If her account of the events is true, I would have found her body in her room after the act – whereas I saw her commit suicide before my very eyes, which explains why I had my family sent away to safety before reporting her death, because I predicted you would react badly—”<br>“You truly have no understanding of human emotion, do you?” Durdhara whispered in a hushed whisper, as if he were making a profound discovery about human nature, “You calculating, stone-faced, heartless Brāhmaṇa, never dispensing with the logic—”<br>“Princess, my account is confirmed by witnesses—”<br>Augraseniya bellowed. “WITNESSES? Why, because my beloved’s word counts for nothing? And only half of your supposed witnesses even confirmed your account – the other half denied even being there!”<br>“Because they are afraid of you—”<br>His brother Kaivarta interrupted, his face lighting up in newfound realization. “He killed our grandfather,” he announced, “I’m sure he did. Then he killed our father. And then he came for you. He is … I swear, brother – as long as I am alive, I will be by your side, and so will our sister – he will have nobody to replace you with. Nobody.”<br>The young emperor’s face, however, showed no signs of acknowledgement – instead, it only bore a look of heavy thoughtfulness, and everyone in the courtroom knew better than to speak before him and get beheaded.<br>When he spoke, it was almost a hushed whisper.<br>“He came for me,” he repeated the words of his brother, his pace slow and filled with such bittersweet, genuine emotion, “He came for me. But my beloved Rūpakośa took the poison for me.”<br>Sakadala exclaimed in frustration. “Rūpakośa was a spy!”<br>“Rūpakośa was my friend!” Durdhara retorted – she was shaking. “She was not a spy – I know it. I feel it. Do you know what it means, to truly know a person, a friend, a family member, a lover? I knew Rūpakośa, and so did my brother. And … and if what you are saying were even – and I cannot even force myself to consider this possibility – if any of it were true, if she committed suicide before you – then when would she have written the letter?”<br>“She DIDN’T. It was not found on her person. It was later fabricated, by another spy. There is a conspiracy—”<br>“Another spy?” cried a courtier, “So I suppose we are all spies now, are we not?”<br>“No,” said Sakadala, his eyes narrowing, “But by that reaction, I find it likely that you are one.”<br>“So yes,” cried another “We are all spies, everybody, we are all spies! And fools – if we were to believe this drivel!”<br>The Emperor raised one hand.<br>The court went silent.<br>His eyes were closed.<br>They waited.<br>“For the assassinations of two successive reigning kings … ” (his voice was heavy, and unstable) “for the assassination attempt on a third, for conspiracy against the royal family and the state, and for the … and for the MURDER of my dear, innocent, Rūpakośa … BEHEAD HIM! BEHEAD HIM, AND THEN ALL HIS SUPPOSED WITNESSES!”<br>But the official executioner had taken Sakadala’s side.<br>So soldiers marched forward, swords drawn, but gait uncertain.<br>A defensive phalanx formed around the Prime Minister, and some archers began pre-emptively shooting at the others, sowing confusion.<br>Another defensive phalanx quickly formed around Augraseniya – and around Kaivarta, and Durdhara, as it became clear what was happening.<br>The Prime Minister took to his steed – as his loyal soldiers slaughtered the guards, taking them by surprise.<br>As the faction of the army loyal to him followed to surround him, he stopped and called out:<br>“And to respond to your accusations, Kaivarta,” he pronounced slowly, “The instability of the throne of Pāṭaliputra well predates my presence here, but your own dynasty does not, having been installed by me. Nonetheless, there are several different competent men I could place on the throne in place of your brother.”<br>ravana_duryodhana<br><br><br>
Ravana, unwilling under the influence of vanity to restore a stranger's wife; Duryodhana, to part with a portion of his kingdom; Dambhodbhava and Arjuna of the Haihaya dynasty being so haughty as to despise all people; Vatapi in his attempt under the influence of overjoy to attack Agastya, as well as the Vṛṣṇi corporation in their attempt against Dvaipayana.
Thus these and other several kings, falling a prey to the aggregate of the six enemies and having failed to restrain their organs of sense, perished together with their kingdom and relations. Having driven out the aggregate of the six enemies, Ambarisha of the Jamadagnya dynasty, famous for his restraint over the senses long enjoyed the earth, as did Nabhaga.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 1.6:5-12
<br>It was a fallacy, Cāṇakya would say – even though the literature was often written in such terms as to say “one who does such activity will surely achieve such result” – to view any man, even himself, as an infallible genius – one who could foresee all the exact consequences of his potential decisions, and act accordingly. Even predicting the outcome of a single social interaction was infeasible – much less that of a whole chain, or several interlocking chains of such events. Thus, it was always necessary to have a large number of well-thought-out plans with a substantial chance of success, so that at least one comes to fruition – it was necessary to ensure your future plans did not depend on any particular thread – and it was important to so fully understand the social and political institutions that existed that any plot you carried out felt as natural as a motion of your body, the same advice as was taught to those learning to ride a horse for the first time.<br>The assassination of Dhanānanda had only two goals, intended by Cāṇakya: one, to silence him before it became known that the emergency edict demanding the states of the Central Country to send their armies Westward to fight the Greeks was forged – and he had increased the success of this plan by exerting an influence on the crown prince via Rūpakośa and by framing the Greeks for the assassination so as to portray anyone (especially Sakadala, the one sane man holding the Magadhi state together) who doubted the edict as treasonous – and two, to create an atmosphere of instability within Magadha, so as to make a future transition of power seem more acceptable.<br>But the plan accomplished much more than even the young professor had anticipated.<br>Rūpakośa’s death had provoked a tripartite civil war in Magadha – the parties to which were:<br>One, an emperor who had consulted with a Brāhmaṇa seer, and for whatever reason – some believed that the hypnotist had subtly implanted a thought, some believed that the influence of Rūpakośa had altered his character – did not despise Brāhmaṇas – did not even insult the caste of the man who was believed to have murdered his father!<br>Two, a rebel prince who had studied in Takṣaśilā and explicitly proclaimed his acceptance of a Brāhmaṇa professor and of the Vedic ways.<br>Three, a literal Brāhmaṇa. Who, despite having murdered the reigning Magadhi emperor, was somehow not only considered an actual contender for the throne, but even enjoyed the open support of a large number of important members of the Magadhi government – perhaps even more closeted supporters – and nobody even seemed to be bothered by this!<br>One thing had become very clear to the people of Magadha:<br>Their way of life was dying.<br>The Brāhmaṇas were winning.<br>The light of the Vedas was burning through the country—<br>—for the Sun had risen in the West.]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/3/3.9.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/3/3.9.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 14:20:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[3.10]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>[date:-322|magadha,x]<br>To the unwitting observer, the line-up – rows as far as the eye could see, of armoured war-elephants and foot soldiers faced against phalanxes and cavalry – seemed like a war of proportions only ever heard of in the poetry of Hesoid and Homer.<br>The two greatest empires in the world – there was hardly any portion of the world that was not ruled by one of them – stood in line for battle, for the ultimate test of civilizations.<br>The eagle stood only some stadia from the elephant.<br>But Seleucus Nicator, the inheritor of Persia after the death of Alexander, was hardly unwitting.<br>He had raced his horse by the side of Alexander’s since the days of his youth – and had still done so during that landmark battle against Porus, and he had seen, for himself, the capacities of a small Indian state that covered hardly a strip of land. They had never lost nearly as many men as they had in India – and that was only to conquer some marginal territories far removed from the core base in the East that they had only recently learned about.<br>(“Marginal territories,” he had said once in jest, “Like, the Athens of the Indians!”)<br>“Brother,” Thera begged, “You are sending our men to India to die! You cannot do this … why not simply focus our efforts Westward?”<br>Even knowing all that she could tell him, Seleucus simply shook his head.<br>&nbsp;“Thera … I do not know what the outcome will be in the West. Iran is all I have – and I must fight for every piece of land of mine that is threatened.”<br>“But you do know what the outcome will be in the East! We will lose – you know this … Why are you doing this, brother?”<br>“Do you remember, Thera, how King Porus sent his army to fight Alexander – fully aware, I’m sure, of his impending defeat?”<br>Thera nodded.<br>“He did so at the expense of his army, and almost at the expense of his entire country. But there was one matter of profit to him – do you know what that is?”<br>“That Alexander, by chance, showed him mercy and decided to appoint him as a satrap? Is that how you hope to be treated by the Indians now?”<br>“It destroyed our ambitions of marching further East. It showed us the might of Indian steel – we realized that if this minor chieftain of an insignificant territory could almost equal the strength of the yet-invincible Macedonian army … we truly stood no chance against the Easterners – and this, he did for the countries to his East, which he did not even rule, out of a loyalty towards his race. In this battle, I am Porus, and the Indians are the Greeks – and I must show them the might of my steel – so that even if they take our territories within India, no one of them will ever think to march towards Persia.”<br>“To send a message,” Thera repeated bitterly, “And how many Greek lives is that one message worth?”<br>“Why, to Leonidas,” Seleucus remarked, “it was worth the entire world.”<br>scheme_6<br><br><br>
Spies, disguised as hunters, may take a stand near the gate of the enemy’s fort to sell flesh, and make friendship with the sentinels at the gate. Having informed the enemy of the arrival of thieves on two or three occasions, they may prove themselves to be of reliable character and cause him to split his army into two divisions and to station them in two different parts of his territory. When his villages are being plundered or besieged, they may tell him that thieves are come very near, that the tumult is very great, and that a large army is required.
They may take the army supplied, and surrendering it to the commander laying waste the villages, return at night with a part of the commander’s army, and cry aloud at the gate of the fort that the thieves are slain, that the army has returned victorious, and that the gate may be opened. When the gate is opened by the watchmen under the enemy’s order or by others in confidence, they may strike the enemy with the help of the army.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 13.3:40-43
<br>The Greek army – despite all that they had been forewarned by their commanders – had retained in their minds a much less threatening picture of the Magadhi army. For it was quite difficult for the mind to imagine numbers and countries so large – it was impossible to fathom what it meant for an army to be a “hundred times the size” of Porus’s, for a country to be as geographically vast as Iran, but with the density of Egypt.<br>The Indian elephantry stood like a wall before them, stretching into the horizon in both directions for.<br>(Out of either suicidal intent or utter insanity, the commanders ordered the Greek infantry to charge at that armoured wall.)<br>The stadia between them shrunk—<br>(He did not quite know what to expect, when the two armies collided – it was as if his mind imagined the elephants would just … stop … perhaps if he roared at them with sufficient fierceness … ?)<br>The elephants did not slow down.<br>(Nikomakhos panicked – but recalled his order, to never step backwards, an obvious order at the time, but now seemed a ridiculous death wish, only retaining its force due to the discipline that had been drilled into him – but surely the commanders had planned something that wouldn’t lead to their utter annihilation within minutes … !)<br>Surround the beasts! Surround them!<br>(It was not like the Greeks were hopelessly outmatched – any phalanx formation other than the Macedonian phalanx would surely have been immediately obliterated, but the depth of the Macedonian phalanx allowed it to stab at the beasts’ legs with an entire matrix of spears.)<br>The elephants were heavily armoured, even in their legs.<br>And they were equipped with giant tree trunks and spiked metal plates and other terror-inducing contravariances that could utterly obliterate the Greek formations if used effectively.<br>(And then a horrible thought struck Nikomakhos – and he so dearly wished he would just stop being struck by all these thoughts – just stop thinking in the middle of a battle and just fight his part like had been told to, he had the strength in him to endure a thousand wounds but not to live every moment of his life in the dreadful fear of death—)<br>There was a magnitude of difference between fighting a few scattered elephants deployed on a battlefield – which was already hard enough – and fighting an elephantry – thousands of elephants marching in formation, supporting each other and equipped with various weapons and logistical conveniences.<br>The first was like surrounding a fortress and scaling it.<br>The second … the second truly had no analog in ordinary experience. It was as if the battlefield itself had turned into a city of fortresses, all operating in some horrifyingly efficient synchrony, as if they had inexplicably found themselves inside the jaws of a Corinthian automaton that had turned evil, to be chewed up and spit out.<br>And the Greek commanders seemed to simply have ignored – out of lack of imaginativeness, or purely wishful thinking – this simple, obvious fact.<br>The archers mounted on the elephant were not aiming at them at all. They were aiming over them – at the backs of the soldiers in another phalanx.<br>(A horrible, freezing sensation –<br>NO—NO—<br>Denial<br>THEY NEEDED ARMOUR THAT FULLY COVERED THEIR BACKS—<br>He screamed<br>An arrow stuck out of his compatriot’s neck—<br>And another one fell—)<br>The formations were breaking.<br>The cavalry was called in urgently, to cover the phalanxes from the back with their shields – a sort of demeaning task they had never been assigned to—<br>(And Nikomakhos knew his life was about to end.)<br>Discipline was breaking.<br>The soldiers were screaming.<br>“We’ll cover you!” cried the cavalry, “Hold formations!”<br>But those elephants that had already broken out began to rampage openly, scattering the terrified horses—<br>And the Greek strategy of surrounding elephants individually had left enormous empty spaces on the battlefield for the Indian infantry and cavalry to charge in, killing the Greek horses – tossing the barely armoured Greek cavalrymen onto the open battleground, vulnerable and directionless.<br>(Do you now see my wisdom, Supushpa, in keeping the majority of the army in reserve? asked Vrishabhadutta, the Indian companion of Speusippos.<br>The commander grunted.<br>This new commander we are fighting … his advisor is of most feared strategic acumen in all India – we needed to learn his strategy with a test.<br>What do you suggest we do now, Rasobdatus?<br>The Indian hummed thoughtfully.<br>There are only four known ways to fight elephants, he said. One – through a prior set-up to sabotage the elephantry from the inside by means of treason – which we haven’t done. Two – by frightening the elephants and causing them to run out of their mahouts’ control, against the invading army itself – but this army seems much too disciplined for such strategies to work—<br>Get to the point faster, Rasobdatus!<br>Three – by using a larger elephantry against it – which we don’t have.<br>Rasobdatus! My men are dying! What should I do?<br>Avoid the elephants entirely, by going around them. The Greek army has mobility, so this will work.<br>But, Rasobdatus, that would be a logistical miracle—<br>Do it.)<br>At the new orders, the Greeks dropped their heavy shields and spears and split into two, running sideways (and a little backward, to compensate for the forward push of the Indian forces). The Indian commanders had ordered their forces to not attempt pursuing the Greek army but instead simply march forward at a disciplined pace – for they did not want to open up wide gaps between their elephants.<br>(Speusippos beamed with pride. His forces – his forces – successfully completed a close and most risky maneouvre – flanking the entire Indian army. The Indian elephantry, under orders to keep marching forward, had no systematic means of pursuing his forces any longer. His forces were only minutes away from being firmly inside Indian territory, only days away from completely cutting off Indian supply lines, only weeks away from reclaiming the territory that the Easterners had taken from them and dealing a severe blow to them, and only years away from launching an attack on the Easterners’ territory itself!<br>The aged Macedonian champion – a celebrated hero of so many wars that he had fought for Phillip, then Alexander, and now Seleucus – had seen the face of Seleucus, seen the resigned defeat in his eyes. But this had not deterred the old veteran from stepping up to the challenge, offering his leadership in this battle. For all those wrinkles of old age, all those scars of battle – they had not been on his spirit, his resolve, those remaining traces of that optimism that had once marked his youthful masculinity.<br>He had taken an expert Indian advisor who was familiar with the enemy, he had reinstated that old combination of heroism and discipline that had taken root under Alexander, done all that was possible to win this war that all seemed to think was unwinnable – inspired his soldiers, declaring: as Alexander defeated what was then the greatest empire known to us, we shall defeat the greatest empire known to us now! – for such is the spirit of the Greeks, that we rise to defeat every challenge that once appeared to be unsurmountable!<br>He would finally be recognized for all that he had done for the throne of Macedon, finally rewarded with more than just a dozen titles – he would accomplish, at this age, what even Alexander could not achieve – give some meaning to his life after all these years – have his own country to rule–)<br>And then the first bombs exploded.<br>gita_2<br><br><br>

If you fight, you will either be slain on the battlefield and go to the celestial abodes, or you will gain victory and enjoy the kingdom on earth.
Therefore arise with determination, O son of Kunti, and be prepared to fight.
—Bhagavad Gītā 2.37
<br>Smoke.<br>Smoke everywhere.<br>Horrid, invisible, devices that exploded – like small volcanoes, but made by men – when tread on, releasing thick black fumes that would almost certainly kill any man who breathed it.<br>The mines were ahead, they were along the outer sides, and the elephantry on the inner side.<br>The Greek soldiers turned around, ready to retreat—<br>But the heavy Indian cavalry had rushed in to block the entrance to the trap, and was closing in.<br>(Speusippos cried out—<br>“The smoke is a feint! It is not poisonous! Do not retreat!”)<br>Even if they had been able to hear him, they would not have cared.<br>They would not have trusted the words of a lunatic commander who was willing to sacrifice his men’s lives for his fantastical dreams.<br>The Greeks who had been caught in the trap dropped their arms in surrender.<br>And those who didn’t, rushed back in a rout – pursued by the Indian cavalry that was emerging from between the legs of their elephants.<br>(The old champion watched in dismay, as the whole world that he had built up in his mind came crashing down – none of his dreams to reach fruition—<br>“Do not retreat! Stay and fight! Tell your compatriots to rush through the smoke! I beg you!”)<br>Not one Greek made it back to hear his words.<br>(NO.<br>I DO NOT ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN.<br>THE WORLD IS MINE, AND I WILL NOT ALLOW IT TO BEHAVE THIS WAY AGAINST ME.)<br>Speusippos took to his steed.<br>“Supushpa—” Vrishabhadutta started.<br>“I do not know if you have betrayed me, my friend.”<br>(The Greek commander’s voice had gained a certain clarity – a disillusionment, or at least what he believed to be a disillusionment.)<br>“But I do know this – none of these traps, none of this deception, none of this cunning of the Indians, can match the will of this old Macedonian. If no one in my army wishes to follow me – to accompany me to my glory – then so be it! This Speusippos alone shall channel the might of all the gods – I alone will be the human representative of those gods who brought us this far – and will for us to go much further!”<br>With a guttural roar, and armed with nothing but a sword and shield – with not a single companion by his side, for Vrishabhadutta would not allow it – the old Greek champion charged against the army of the greatest empire known to the world.<br>He fell dead to a stray arrow to the neck.<br>hunter<br><br><br>
With regard to a wise and a brave prince, a wise prince, even if timid, is characterized with capacity for intellectual works; and a brave prince even if not wise, possesses warlike spirit. So far as warlike spirit is concerned, a wise prince overreaches a brave one just as a hunter does an elephant.

 <br><br>writ<br><br><br>
Preceptors say that the word “command”, is applicable only to royal writs. Writs are of great importance to kings inasmuch as treaties and ultimate leading to war depend upon writs.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 2.10:1
Later commentary: As oral order sent through messengers is liable to misrepresentation, owing to misunderstanding, carelessness, and want of intelligence of the messengers, it is only writing on palm leaf that deserves the name of royal order

However, mutually beneficial trades may be facilitated.<br>Of conflicts over mutually interesting territory: There is a possibility that either party may wage war in a region not controlled by either party, but is of interest to both. In such an event, the parties may fail to co-ordinate their efforts or to reach an agreement on the sharing of what is acquired. To avoid this cost, the following norms are instituted:<br>First: Both parties recognize each other as imperial powers with ambitions exceeding their current control. All the countries of Bhāratavarṣa, the countries to its East by sea, the countries to the East of Kaśmīra, and all islands under 40 yojanas from the coast of Bhāratavarṣa are considered the “realm” of Candragupta; all the countries currently under the rule of a tribe of Yavanas, all the countries to their West, and all islands within 40 yojanas of any of these countries, are consisidered the “realm” of Suluva. Neither party will wage war, without permission, in the realm of the other party. If they wage such a war, all that is acquired from that war shall be handed to the other party, unless explicitly sold to them by the other party.<br>Second: The parties may, through mutual agreement, change the constitution of these realms only if one of them finds in the other’s realm a serious threat to his own security – but not in response to finding in the other’s realm an article of great value.<br>Third: Neither party will be held responsible for the actions of other rulers in his realm that he has not yet conquered, and is not responsible for nuisances to the other party arising from such faults.<br>Fourth: The countries not listed as part of the realms of either party: the nomadic tribes of beyond the Northern Highway, the countries of the Black Greeks and many mid-laying various islands of the Sea of Gems, are considered the realm of barbarians, and efforts by either party to conquer them are considered honourable.<br>Fifth: If a conflict ever does arise, both parties must take care to ensure the conflict does not affect the peace in other areas, and does not nullify any part of this treaty on questions explicitly addressed by it.<br>Of relationships with the other party’s enemies: Neither party may sell any such good to a country that the other party is at war with, which they would themselves block to their enemy in wartime. Both parties will make reasonable efforts to prevent private merchants under their sovereignty from making such trades.<br>SECTION TWO: TRADE<br><br><br>seleucus_thera<br><br>To my dear sister Thera:<br>It seems that in meeting the Indians, at last the Greek cunning has found its match.

 <br><br>theory_practice<br><br><br>
It is not only in this but in many other cases that, though the practice of a science is known to all, only a few persons are acquainted with the theory of that science.
—Vatsyayana, in the Kāma Sutra, 1.3
<br>[Scene] Cāṇakya’s quarters, his back is faced towards the door while Candragupta sits apart from him.<br>“Professor,” he said, “While I have no lack of trust in your judgement, you yourself have often taught that it is often beneficial that at least a few people should be informed of and consulted with regards to important plans. The end result of your plot is eminently beautiful, but I must ask what the precise means were that allowed you to accomplish it.”<br>(“Even the most cunning plotter may neglect, out of wishful thinking and excitement over the sheer cleverness of his plot, the many ways in which his plan may go wrong, the many gaps left unanswered in its execution, the many ways that an enemy of equal intellect could sabotage it, and the many unintended and unforeseen consequences. Many of these risks disappear upon consultation with even one other person who was not part of the planning, better yet if that person knows to think like an economist, or if he knows to think like the enemy.”)<br>Cāṇakya raised an eyebrow slyly. “Usually, the details of a plan are only shared with those with agency to act on matters pertaining to it. Do you have such ambitions for yourself?”<br>Candragupta did not, this time, protest. He did not turn red at Cāṇakya’s suggestion. He did not feel an urge to indignantly defend, against such an accusation, his loyalty to Pabbata. He had never said it out loud, but in truth, ever since the little game that Pabbata had played to try and take Candragupta out of the picture … Candragupta’s bond to the Prince of Magadha had been permanently broken.<br>For the first time in his life, no longer constrained by the bonds of loyalty, Candragupta had felt … ambition. And what was most remarkable, he had observed, was that ambition creates ability – or at least discovers it: by virtue of being willing to do things, because he himself wanted them, he had discovered in himself the ability to do these things – because discovering such an ability is not something you could just be told to do.<br>It didn’t matter to him that this breaking of trust had precisely been Cāṇakya’s goal in setting up that game – he was simply better-off now than before, and was not going back. It didn’t matter to him that Cāṇakya was simply now his new master – Cāṇakya’s power was earned, he held it because he was best-equipped to wield it, not because he was born a prince.<br>So he simply smiled and said: “Well, apparently I already am the king of the Central Country, so it is not agency I lack.”<br>They exchanged a knowing glance.<br>“You worry that the Greeks will find out that you are not truly the true king of the Āryas,” Cāṇakya stated. “That the image we have painted – of two empires: the Easterners, i.e. Augraseniya’s Magadha, and the Gangetic empire, i.e. the Central Country, ruled by you – will be exposed as a fake, and they will learn that in fact, they as well as Magadha have fallen prey to a heist of unprecedented proportions.”<br>Candragupta nodded.<br>“What you need to understand, Candragupta, is that unlike in the physical sciences, where truth determines belief, in the science of government, belief determines truth. A government holds power only insofar as people believe it does – and when there is a lack of clarity in what is real, you can mould reality to your wishes.”<br>“Chaos favours the powerless,” Candragupta thought aloud.<br>“No. Chaos is not a favourable state for anyone in the long run, that is why we have governments. But chaos favours those who seek power. It is a strategy, not a virtue.”<br>“I see. So by assassinating Dhanānanda, no one can verify the authenticity of the message you forged in his name – so Magadha will not dispute the right of its vassals in the Central Country to send its armies to march against the Greeks. When these armies arrived in Punjab, you forged an alliance between them and my band of Bāhlīka mercenaries, so that when the commanders of the vassal armies were assassinated, I could play the natural hero to lead them into battle. But I still do not see how this stops the Greeks from seeing through our plan. Couldn’t they learn from literally anyone that the Central Country is ruled by Magadha, and that I am neither the king of Magadha, nor do I have any political power in the Central Country?”<br>“Think clearly, Candragupta, it is the same principle – and do note: it is not absurd for even a vassal to fashion himself as a king of power and importance.”<br>Candragupta thought for a while, then answered: “It doesn’t matter if the Greeks learn any of this. Because by their very acceptance of this treaty, they have given me some measure. Until this deal was formed, I had no reasonable claim to suzerainty over the Central Country– but now I do, and they have no reason to support any other claimants. They do not feel as though they’ve been tricked, as there is sufficient ambiguity on the matter of sovereignty – from their eyes, I simply appear to be an actor in the civilized world’s political theatre who used the conflict against them cement my power, and it would be foolish of them to make an enemy out of me, an ascendant power in the civilized world’s politics.”<br>“And because you have already decisively crushed them once in battle.”<br>“But Magadha is in for a nasty shock when they find out what we’ve done,” Candragupta said a little fearfully. “Surely they see our ambitions – and they will not stay quiet.”<br>Cāṇakya smiled. “So I have shown you an example of how to plot, Candragupta. The next plot will be left as an exercise to you: how can we dampen Magadha’s response? I already know the answer, but you must learn to start solve these problems yourself.”<br>council<br><br><br>
All kinds of administrative measures are preceded by deliberations in a well-formed council. The subject matter of a council shall be entirely secret and deliberations in it shall be so carried that even birds cannot see them; for it is said that the secrecy of counsels was divulged by parrots, minas, dogs and other low creatures of mean birth. Hence without providing himself with sufficient safeguard against disclosure, he shall never enter into deliberations in a council.
Whoever discloses counsels shall be torn to pieces.
The disclosure of counsels may be detected by observing changes in the attitude and countenance of envoys, ministers, and masters. Change in conduct is change in attitude; and observation of physical appearance is countenance.
Maintenance of the secrecy of a council-matter, and keeping guard over officers that have taken part in the deliberation over it (shall be strictly observed) till the time of starting the work so considered approaches.
Carelessness, intoxication, sleep-talking, love and other evil habits of councillors are the causes of the betrayal of counsels.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 1.15:2-12
<br>The servant opened the door when prompted by Candragupta.<br>“Prime Minister Kautilya,” said a voice that Cāṇakya recognized as that of Megasthenes, the translator from the Greeks, “There is a rather special personal matter we would like to speak with you on.”<br>That reminded him. “Ah yes,” said Cāṇakya without looking back, “I was about to tell you myself. Pāṇini is a close friend of mine who is quite interested in the study of language, and he thought it would be beneficial to speak with a man familiar with the Greek language. I would like to invite you to live in Takṣaśilā as an ambassador of the Greeks to our country.”<br>“Pardon me?”<br>“You will be paid well, do not worry. and we will compensate your current employer too, as you will be representing them in our court.”<br>“I have no employer!”<br>“Oh, you are a freelancer? Well I suppose we don’t have to compensate your current employer then.”<br>“You wish to employ the king of Persia to help your friend learn Greek?”<br>“Well he’s not really planning to learn Greek—wait, you’re the king of Persia? I thought that was the other guy.”<br>Candragupta was stifling laughs. Now Cāṇakya was just puzzled. (“What happened to you?”)<br>“What other guy?”<br>“The fat one?”<br>Now Candragupta just laughed out loud, and Cāṇakya had to turn back to learn what exactly he was missing out on—<br>Oh.<br>“I see,” he said, holding down a smile. “Forgive me. What do you want?”<br>Seleucus spoke flatly, and Megasthenes translated, himself looking rather embarrassed.<br>“The other guy wishes to invite you to his quarters. His fatness has a personal matter he would like to discuss with you.”<br>boomer<br><br><br>
Truth and virtue they hold alike in esteem. Hence they accord no special privileges to the old unless they possess superior wisdom.
—Megasthenes, according to Strabo XV, i. 53-56, pp. 709-10.

meal_timing<br><br><br>
But other things the Indians do which one cannot approve: for instance, that they eat always alone, and that they have no fixed hours when meals are to be taken by all in common, but each one eats when he feels inclined. The contrary custom would be better for the ends of social and civil life.
—Megasthenes, according to Strabo XV, i. 53-56, pp. 709-10.

tall<br><br><br>
They are tall in stature, in fact the tallest in Asia, most of them being five cubits in height, or a little less. They are darker than other men, except the Ethiopians, and in war they are far the bravest of all the races of Asia.
—Arrian, Anabasis Alexandri 5.4
<br>“It would have been quite embarrassing for you,” Cāṇakya commented, “If you were to come all the way here only to find that it was some other Brāhmaṇa with a scarred jaw.”<br>“After the troubles I took to come here,” said Thera, “I would have just married him anyway.”<br>Cāṇakya laughed a little.<br>“Do you know how risky it is to travel the Persian highway at this time?” Thera continued, her voice rising a little in mock anger. “Bandits, renegade soldiers, crazy Iranians who don’t understand they’ve lost – maybe even spies from our Greek rivals – Ptolemy is a good man, but a terribly cunning one, Oh WHO am I saying this to?—”<br>This time it was Cāṇakya who cut her off with the same gesture that she had used on him so many years back.<br>Thera was quiet for some time, suddenly very shy.<br>“Well,” she said at last, “I am glad that you and Seleucus came to make peace.”<br>She had been distraught when she had learned that Alexander was waging war in the very country that had given her education – and even more troubled when she had learned that her brother’s territory had been invaded by an army that she had already suspected to be led by Cāṇakya.<br>“I imagine there were people you know among the Greek casualties in these wars,” Cāṇakya stated. “Just as I knew many on the Ārya side.”<br>Thera nodded, recalling the leathery, wrinkled face of Speusippos. His family had never been high enough in status to socialize with the noble families of Macedon, despite his attempts to ingratiate himself with them, but the old man’s honesty had always impressed her.<br>“But you are a princess of noble blood,” he continued. “I hope that you means you understand what it means to let bygones be bygones.”<br>Thera stiffened her jaw, suppressing her emotions. “That we do not dwell, after peace is made, on the wounds of the past.”<br>Cāṇakya didn’t say anything to her for a while, only staring with an unreadable expression.<br>“And towards those who still dwell on those wounds,” he said finally, “We do our best to act kindly towards them.”<br>“Who … ?”<br>He took another long pause before replying, and when he finally did, it was heart-wrenching to hear.<br>“I have already one wife,” he said. “I married her on account of a political alliance – but nonetheless she is dear to me, and will not pick a principal wife and disrespect her thus.”<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>“Okay.”<br>“She is the daughter of King Puruśottama. I have not heard her thoughts on the matter exactly, but they are an emotional people, and as you know, her brother was killed by Seleucus himself in battle.”<br>Thera held her breath.<br>“It is just something you need to know. You will not be meeting her any time soon – or, for that matter, me. I am in the midst of several important wars right now. You can stay in Takṣaśilā, or here at Kapīśa if you so prefer … ”<br>Why, oh, why, Thera thought, did matters need to be so complicated? What was she even to say to a girl whose brother had died at the hands of her brother? “Sorry, my brother is evil, I agree”? “No, it was your brother who was evil, my brother was right to kill him”? What opinion was she have to on such a question? Was it precisely to avoid such questions that the ancients had invented notions like honour? So you could claim that both sides were simply performing their duties – and both ought to be honoured? But both could not be right – who was right – and how could you maintain such a pretense with someone who ought to be close to you? With Cāṇakya she was not afraid of approaching any subject, assuming he was still the man she knew, that had always been the nature of their relationship, and Cāṇakya could never feel offense from the sort of things that normal people felt offense at, he would never indignantly demand that she feel a certain way or respect a certain thing (unless that thing was the truth, or the goals of human pursuit) – and she would even get a satisfactory answer to her current angst, but would it be the sort of answer she could give to this girl she did not even know? Thera dreaded – and may the gods forgive her for having this thought – but she dreaded having to meet this woman …<br>Cāṇakya, meanwhile, held a measured expression.<br>He did not express elation at meeting Thera again, and indeed of making her his wife.<br>He did not express any petty qualms on the matters that occupied Thera’s thoughts.<br>He did not express any grief over having to manipulate yet another innocent woman, for his profit, into her certain doom.<br>woman_scorned<br><br><br>
It is said that a woman making love of her own initiative will, when discarded, curse the man.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 5.6:30
<br>“Why all the efforts to obtain the Greek troops?” Candragupta asked.<br>“You mean, why go to such lengths to manipulate Seleucus into proposing the idea of trading troops himself, rather than simply demand it from him?”<br>Candragupta nodded. “And more generally, why is it so important that we obtain Greek troops per se?”<br>“While we are able to raise a decent amount of wealth with the Seal of the Peacock,” Cāṇakya answered, “It does not nearly match the wealth of the treasury of Magadha. We will be sabotaging them in many ways, of course, but nonetheless, chaos favours us – and the more factions we can introduce into the scene, the more plots I can carry out.”<br>“ … what is your plot with the Greek troops, Professor?”<br>Cāṇakya stopped walking.<br>“I intend to stage a barbarian invasion of Āryāvarta,” he said. “And you will lead the defense against it.”]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/3/3.12.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/3/3.12.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 14:27:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[4 Āryāvarta Kāṇḍa]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br><br>dasarajna<br><br>“Salutations to Parjanya!” had cried the Great Sage Vasiṣṭha.<br>“Salutations to Parjanya!” had cried the Great King Sudās.<br>“Salutations to Parjanya!” had cried the mountains, had cried the overcast skies.<br>“Salutations to Parjanya!” had cried the army of the Bhāratas, charging their chariots in teutonic fury, lightning flaring in the background, and their enemies, drowning in the River Irāvatī whose dykes Vasiṣṭha had breached, had known their time had come. The Alliance of the Ten Kings had been crushed, Sudās had ascended the throne as king of all men, and Vasiṣṭha had held high the eternal flame of the Bhāratas before a saluting populace.<br>After the generation of Vasiṣṭha and Sudās, after at most the generation of their many grandchildren, that is all that man remembered.<br>But victory was decided before even the conches of battle were blown – the battle only served to inform men of what was already known to the gods. For the many Bhārata men and women who had given their lives in the years leading up to the battle, their prize was not glory, not attention, not recognition – their only prize was victory.<br>
Today, well before either Cāṇakya and Candragupta would set foot again in Magadha themselves, wars were underway, in three theatres.<br>war_update<br><br>WAR UPDATE.<br>(Present to hear: Cāṇakya, Candragupta, Pāṇini, Apratimaujas, Daṇḍaśarman, Śrībhānu, the walls of the University of Takṣaśilā)<br>In the Eastern theatre, in Magadha—<br>As you know, Pabbata has by now lived among the people for seven years, gaining popularity among them and influencing their sentiment to be sympathetic to me and to the Vedic culture. Now with the assassination of his father, and conspiracy theories blaming Augraseniya or Sakadala as the culprit – or even that they are both in cahoots and only pretending to war, Pabbata has started to campaign in the countryside, and has already captured numerous forts.<br>I have been informed by one of my spies that some of the Magadhas, associating all three parties to the Civil War with the Brāhmaṇas whom they still despise, have taken to a fourth leader: an army general named Kalmasanghri of Rajagriha, who claims all the events underway to be the conspiracy of the Brāhmaṇas. I have reason to believe, however, that there is no cause to fear him.<br>Between Sakadala and Augraseniya, the treasury and most of the bureaucracy are favourable to Sakadala, while the palace-keepers and judiciary are favourable to Augraseniya; parts of the military are favourable to either side, while the majority wishes to unite against Pabbata as a common enemy.<br>Augraseniya correctly sees the treasury’s support for Sakadala as a threat, and will surely have most of the treasury-keepers executed – but he will do so in secret, so that it does not become known that the treasury is unguarded. Expecting this, I have made a plan that I will describe to you in brief: apparently operating on behalf of Sakadala, one spy in the army will launch an attack on the palace, apparently threatening the treasury but in reality focusing to sabotage the dams, sluices, all other machines controlling the flow of water, and the bridges; frightened, Augraseniya will attempt to have the treasury’s wealth relocated quickly to Rajagriha, where support for him is more secure; but in doing so, they will have to cross the river; spies in the army will pursue them, causing them to be hasty to leave the city; they will then be ambushed by Pabbata at the river, who will seize from them what wealth he can and cast the rest into the water. We may expect a great amount of labour to be spent into salvaging this wealth from the river – but it will take a long time for any significant amount of wealth to be retrieved, by when we will have won the war.<br>In the Central theatre, in the Central Country—<br>As you know, there are three events of significance that have given us almost a free hand in operating our spying activities in the occupied Central Country.<br>One, the extensive troubles in Magadha, and my extraction of the majority of the vassal state armies into the West to fight the Greeks, have left the Central Country almost unguarded in a sense. Not so unguarded that Magadha would allow a military invasion of the country, but it will overlook, or lacks the capacity to identify and stop, destabilizing activities. The problem with the Magadhis’ tyrannical approach to ruling is that simply executing the ruling noble families does not replace the underlying state infrastructure, which remains at least subconsciously sympathetic to the cause of overthrowing Magadhi rule. Thus we have, by inducing popular gossip, ignited new topics of discussion among the people: reminiscing about the past, instilling self-pride, tales of being saved by a messiah or hero, and need for unity against invaders such as the Greeks and other barbarians. I have, through such debates, pushed our people to be respected in society. This, along with the fact that much of their armies are currently under Candragupta’s command, will surely aid in inciting the states of the Central Country to betray Magadha at the time we will need them to.<br>Two, my provocation of Magadha into starting a trade war with the Ayudhajivi states has effectively closed Magadha off not only to trade, but also to information. Already due to their troubles, they are neglecting the importance of conveying as much information as is necessary to even maintain an empire; with the natural movement of traders stopped, we are able to keep track of who traverses the Northern Highway, and what information Magadha receives about the war in the Western theatre. This will also be of crucial importance to us later when we attack Magadha – for it will enable us to send falsified information about the war to each vassal, telling them that the remaining vassals have surrendered, or that Magadha has fallen, and so on.<br>Three, acquiring the Seal of the Peacock has given me magical powers. Or so at least I am able to convince many into believing. I am running a large financial scam – or rather, what would be a financial scam if we do not win this war, and end up unable to pay back these loans – where I simply promise each investor double his investment, and pay him off with the next investor’s money. Some believe this is possible for me because the Seal of the Peacock has granted me a great knowledge of alchemy, for Mathura has always been a centre for the study of alchemy; other believe it because I have successfully paid back some of the first investors; and a few see that it is a scam but think they can profit off it anyway, or correctly expect us to win the war and pay them back with tax money.<br>In the Western theatre, in Punjab—<br>Having sent away the armies of the Mallas and Kāśī, which are much more loyal to the Magadhi leadership, to the Greeks as part of the exchange agreement, the armies of the remaining vassals can almost be said to be ours. They are aware of the Civil War in Magadha and wish to play no part of it, instead choosing to place their faith in Candragupta’s leadership. They will stay under our command, as long as we can find a suitable excuse to keep them.<br>Possessing command of such a mighty army and having been the ones to retake their territory from the Greeks, our rule over Punjab, Sindh and the mountainous regions are uncontested by the local rulers. To make sure that they stay loyal, do not attempt to collaborate with our enemies, and do not interfere with our plans, I am instituting spies and other instruments to project our imperial sovereignty in these countries. There is no doubt that any of them could send messages to Magadha about our deceit – but due to our control over the Northern Highway, we can also send conflicting messages, and because Magadha is currently polarized in a Civil War, the choice of which messages to believe will start to organize themselves randomly by party lines, with or without our spies there actively fanning the flame.<br>Make no mistake of it: if I wished to destroy the Magadhi empire today, I could do it – that is how unstable it is. But doing so would not grant me the power I seek – and it is not desirable to let others gain power, for it is completely unpredictable what they may do with it. Thus all our endeavours from this point forward are in the interest of ensuring the stability of our future empire.<br><br>ghrtaci_3<br><br>TO GHṚTĀCĪ, THE QUEEN OF THE MATSYAKA SCYTHIANS<br>It is time.<br>Your war has begun.]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/4/4.1.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/4/4.1.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2024 19:27:40 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[4.2]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>King of Mathura calls council of kings, Chanakya an unexpected guest. Chanakya advises: Chandragupta may not have a noble lineage, but the Nandas have the opposite of one. The lack of a noble lineage means no information on his honorability, but for the Nandas, we have information against their honorability. I would say give him a chance, but that is underselling it, he is our beacon of hope. I have monitored multiple candidates, including Pabbata. But Chandragupta has a sensibility that fits him to be king – I do not wish to speak ill of the dead, but Pabbata was immature to attack Pataliputra directly. Objection: No doubt Chandragupta is a celebrated hero, but heroes are not meant to rule. Chanakya muses: An upstart hero whose feats gave him the upward mobility to rule as a king among kings. What does that remind me of? Are you comparing Chandragupta to Lord Vishnu? Do not be offended at comparisons, it is an analogy not an equation. Regardless, Chandragupta’s heroism is not that of a warrior, it is that of a leader … The kings agree to let their armies train together. While training, Chandragupta evokes passion in army against Magadha, which Chanakya does amongst the kings.]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/rough/4/conference.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/rough/4/conference.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2024 12:27:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[greek_dark_day]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>
<br>Chandragupta: Won’t the Greeks wise up to our deceit, now that Magadha is back to order? Chanakya: They are currently far more occupied in the Wars of the Diadochi. The possibility to fear is that they abandon their territory in Persia and invade India instead. To prevent that, I have already set events in place. 

<br>Megasthenes and Thera are imprisoned in a high-security prison in an unknown location, not even Taxila
<br>The rumors are spread amongst the public and they start hating the Greeks, the government has to protect the Greeks. Greeks want to leave. Curfews imposed in cities (intention to prevent Greeks from organizing to rebel against government).
<br>Letter to Seleucus from Chandragupta saying they uncovered a plot amongst the Greek troops sent, they have been executed and Megasthenes has been sentenced to death as a Greek spy (with a date that gives Seleucid time to be able to intervene diplomatically), and Thera life imprisoned, it is being debated whether to execute her as she didn’t necessarily have anything to do with it.
<br>Seleucus’s advisor says remember when Chanakya said he was suspected for being too pro-Greek? Maybe this will be damaging politically for him. Why should I care about Chanakya’s political career? Your daughter is Chanakya’s wife, king. Why did I ever agree to this marriage, what have I done to my daughter? Read the rest of the letter. 
<br>Massagetae invasion, it is our belief that you have conspired with the Massagetae, told us under torture, and are mulling the evidence, torturing the Massagetae and Greek troops to extract information, etc.
<br>Chaankya: I have personally intervened on behalf of Thera, but if Seleucid support is seen for the next Massagetae invasion, it will be be politically impossible for me to defend a Greek wife.
<br>Seleucus: we’ll invade India! Advisor: that may not be advisable, king. Megasthenes and Thera are being held not as prisoners, but as hostages. Furthermore, we lost a defensive war against Chandragupta in peaceful times. Here, you are speaking of an offensive war from a far worse position, at a time when our military is already occupied, and if I may say so, getting battered, in the West, and at a time when the civilians of India have become so hostile to the Greeks. We have much to lose if we further strain our relationship with the Indians.
<br>This is a set-up! Indeed, but why would they set this up? Because they want something from us. Offers his support against the Massagetae (no country in Greece or Asia has successfully resisted the Scythians alone).
<br>Chanakya had sent a previous private letter to Seleucus’s advisor intimating him of possible hostilities. I do not believe the accusations of a high-level conspiracy, yet our respective kings may be rash and hot-headed, and escalate to prove their strength. It relies on us men of intellect to protect the peace and prosperity of nations. I am thus entrusting you with the responsibility of preventing Seleucus from doing anything rash, as I am doing with Chandragupta. You may need to tolerate some hostile words from Chandragupta, but I request your co-operation in avoiding unnecessary war, which I am personally distasteful of, or long-term degradation in the very special relationship that we have worked to craft.

 <br>Chanakya initially draws Sakadala into a sense of security thinking that they won’t pay too many costs to conquer Magadha. Sakadala will be expecting us to attack Vaishali first, to secure it. Instead we shall attack Pataliputra and place it under siege, then send an army to fight Vaishali when they are unable to communicate with Pataliputra.

Messenger: If you are afraid that I will be dishonorable and capture or execute you on false pretenses, please be assured that I am not foolish enough to jeopardize the trustworthiness of the Maurya dynasty’s word. I only resort to such cunning when I am weak, not when I have already won. <br>What did you wish to tell me Vishnugupta?<br>I would like to ask your opinion on a quote I’ve been mulling including in my yet-unpublished Arthashastra. In my doctrine of sama-dama-danda-bheda (convincing, price, punishment, deceit), the first item in sama. And there are many forms of sama. A man of pride can be won through flattery, a stupid man can be won through poetic and irrelevant words. But a scholar is won by the truth, and only by the truth. Despite having said so myself, I am aware that this is an idealized daydream – in fact, I have often observed scholars to be the most stubborn and irrational when it comes to changing their mind, because they have placed so much intellectual effort and capital into believing and promoting their professed ideology, that accepting its falsehood becomes more painful than continuing to believe something they know deep down to be false. <br>So I will not attempt to convince you to betray Magadha and to support Chandragupta, that would be futile except on the most enlightened of minds. If you think I would fall for such an obvious trap, Professor, if you think that I am so foolish, then you are mistaken. No, Minister, I believe you are so foolish that you will not recognize the truth of my words and will see it as a trap.<br>However, I believe you can still be convinced of this much, which is also true: The Nanda dynasty has lost the war. Their resistance is a futile exercise in the waste of time, blood and other forms of wealth. Even if you eliminate myself and Chandragupta, and somehow win the loyalty of our army, it is clear that Kaivarta and Panduka are not capable kings in any sense of either word. You are not protecting the rule of the Nanda dynasty but of some future usurper, perhaps a general, or a cousin of the Nandas, or the leader of a new rebellion; in this regard, it is foolish for you to bias against Chandragupta as that usurper.<br>Thus your loyalty to the Nanda dynasty is not only immoral, but a meaningless pretense. You may say that Chandragupta has killed Magadhas, well, so have the Nandas. The only difference from this perspective is that Chandragupta has killed Magadhas loyal to the Nandas – if you weren’t loyal to the Nandas, that would thus be an irrelevant factoid.<br>Your loyalty must be to your knowledge, to your beliefs. And you must consider which employer would value such knowledge and beliefs the most. If you disapprove of Chandragupta’s rule in future, the best play for you is still to accept lower your head for now and plan your coup.<br>What do you want from me? <br>Several things. <br>One. When it becomes clear to you that every aspect of Kaivarta and Pandukas’ cause is intenable, that it is impossible for Magadha to hold onto even an inch of its former territory, I want you to surrender immediately rather than shed more blood of the Magadhan army and then <br>Two. Once Kaivrata and Panduka are ousted and Chandragupta’s rajyabhishekha is complete, I wish that you offer your loyalty to Chandragupta as the new emperor of Magadha, and offer your complete and total support in the transition of power – on issues of administration, politics, and general know-how.<br>And third, and more immediately … Chandragupta will be meeting Princess Durdhara exactly three days from now on the edge of the Rajagiri cliff that faces a lake. I want you to convey this message to Kaivarta and Panduka and make sure it happens. <br>Three days from now, on a cliff’s edge? That is the night of the full moon, indeed an interesting time and location to be meeting a young woman. <br>It was actually so she can’t see the suicide nets.<br>Should I also lower the princess’s inhibitions with alcohol perhaps, Vishnugupta? Do you wish for me to be a priest at the wedding as well? That would be quite appreciated, actually. The second thing, not the first.<br>Very well, Vishnugupta. I shall do what is right.<br>Minister: The Mauryas have asked for a meeting with Durdhara on neutral ground – a cliff edge. I feared at first that they might have wished to hold her hostage, but Vishnugupta is not so foolish to think that we would be so weak. Nonetheless she’s an impressionable girl and he may wish to turn her, I do not recommend agreeing. Three days later, Chandragupta threatens to cut off all food supplies to Pataliputra, and Durdhara agrees to meet.<br><br>Chanakya is the first to talk with her, plays bad cop. <br>Durdhara asks: Professor Vishnugupta. Kautilya Vishnugupta. I have some intellect of my own too, Professor. I know you are here to take me hostage. To exact intolerable emotional cruelties on my brothers and to force them to succumb. <br>If you had any intellect, young woman, you would know that if that was my objective, you would not be meeting with me, but with two goons, and you would not be walking free on a hill top, you would already be a prisoner. The reason you are being treated with such dignity is far more noble, and if you had any intellect, it would have been quite clear to you already, from the fact that I asked to meet with you, rather than with either of your brothers, who hold the political power.<br>Chandragupta will shortly be commencing on the Ashwamedha Yajna after taking Pataliputra, and that ritual needs a wife. I am here to ask, on his behalf, for your hand in marriage. <br>Durdhara horrified: I will marry the man who killed my father? Etc. <br>OK, then what will be your brideprice? Durdhara horrified: You heartless economist, you think any price—any price— <br>Not even the lives of your brothers? Durdhara horrified again. <br>Chanakya: if you had any intellect, young woman, you would be overjoyed to hear this. Until I suggested this possibility to you, the only future in your mind was the complete annihilation of your family. By giving you this choice I am doing a great kindness to your family, one that is frankly undeserved. You can curse me for subjecting you to a difficult choice, but I have given you a choice nonetheless – one that you did not have prior. <br>You do not truly value the lives of your brothers, only honor. That is why you would rather wish your brothers dead than have the choice to save them with both choices degrading to your honor. <br>Durdhara looks down. Don’t even think about it. Your death will not save your brothers’ lives. In any case, and perhaps more relevant to you, I have placed nets to rescue you if you do jump off, and guards below so the whole thing would simply be an exercise in embarrassment. <br>How dare you? To accept my offer will be a difficult choice, and it will be followed by many similarly difficult choices. When your brothers are in exile in Dandaka, will you live with them at the expense of your comfort, or live in the palace at the expense of your honor? Death is always easier. But at least you will be living true to the morals you profess. You may condemn the choice, but the truth of the matter is that you do have a choice. And by condemning the choice so far as to reject it, you are still making a choice – to let me kill your brothers. What I am offering you is a far greater mercy than is usually offered to those whom we call the losing side.<br>Chandragupta goes next, good cop. <br>Chanakya tells him: go with two bodyguards, then two seconds after stopping next to her, dismiss them asking for privacy. According to my assessment of her character she will be moved by that gesture.<br>Look at that city – it houses 250,000 people. Each man, each woman, each child, living their own lives. Lives that will never be recorded in poetry or literature. The verses of history, do not care about the lives of commoners, wealthy or poor. They will record and romanticize every minor inconvenience in the life of a noblewoman, turn noblemen into heroes or villains based on such conveniences and inconveniences they cause to other nobles, yet will barely condemn him for the civilians lives he takes, nor celebrate him for the prosperity he brings to civilian lives. <br>By my achievements so far, by my popularity among the academics and ousted noble dynasties of Aryavarta I am already guaranteed to be immortalized by history. But that is not all I want. I do not want bloodshed. <br>You do not want bloodshed? Then don’t wage war! <br>My Professor says there are two fundamental values worth protecting: human life, and the meaning of human life. I do not wish to cause you any further pain by speaking ill of your deceased father, but you cannot honestly say that his people had any meaningful life under his reign. The expansion of Magadha has taken countless lives, and the meaning out of the lives of those who survived. My war is a war to end all wars, at least for some period, and to create a peaceful India of perpetually increasing prosperity under which humans can pursue higher and higher goals.<br>You are a student of Vishnugupta, and are just as heartless.<br>My professor has a cold demeanor, but this is his intent as well. The Ashwamedha can be done without our marriage – our marriage is not for the purpose of advancing my political goals, it is to put an end to a war whose outcome is already known, to reduce bloodshed.<br>All his strategy, all his cunning, is with this very goal. In conquering the entirety of Northern India, I have shed no civilian blood, and less blood in total than the Nandas shed in acquiring a single fort.<br>Durdhara: It is not about whose governance is better, it is about loyalty to my family. You killed my father. <br>And your father killed both my parents. So must we despise each other then? But what was your fault in that? Be loyal, to the living: to your brothers, and more importantly to the people and soldiers of Magadha who have suffered enough through these endless wars. Help me create a new era of peace and prosperity. <br>Durdhara: Peace and prosperity? Preventing bloodshed? What would you have done if I hadn’t agreed to meet you. Would you have kept the barricade on Pataliputra until the entire city – its men, women, children, cattle – starved to death? <br>I would’ve chosen whichever route would minimize the suffering of the people of Pataliputra. If that would have meant invading the city by force, or waiting further to pressure Magadha to surrender, would be a matter for my professor to calculate. In any case, I do not claim to have caused no pain in my battles. I do not think even heroes from poetry and plays could live up to that standard. <br>But by asking this question, princess, and in complaining about the relatively little bloodshed that I have caused in my wars, and by calling my professor by such words that you would never have dared speak to your father or even to your brothers, you have already admitted the higher expectations you hold of me, and thus confessed to the superiority of my morals and my ways, over theirs. <br>I wish I could be more perfect in my ways, princess, in a way that even heroes of poetry are not, but it is an impossibility. I wish I could promise to treat even your brothers to a life of comfort after my victory, but political considerations make it an unthinkable risk. But their lives I will spare.<br>And Durdhara, whether our marriage means anything to you in itself, I will always treat you with dignity, as my queen, the prime daughter of Magadha, the land from which I will rule, not as a prisoner of war. This I swear.<br><br>Chandragupta says: she’s a good person. And I was honest with her. <br>Chanakya says: A girl has the right to choose her groom?<br>
Chandragupta: That is the truth.<br>
Yes, but it shows your awareness that she wasn’t being honest with you.<br>You said that because you believed – and correctly so – that to influence her decision. But if it influenced her decision simply as a matter of information, she would have pretended to decline, wait a few days and measure your response. <br>No, it influenced her decision by virtue of being romantic, of making her decision seem honorable, giving her plausible deniability to protect her dignity. She is the sort of pretentious woman who will go to fraudulent unorthodox ascetics and saints asking them to solve her problems, who will then exploit such opportunity for their political gains, and if she does realize this eventually, will pass off her pretentiousness as her “gullibility” or “innocence” and pretend as if that were a noble quality. <br>I advise you, Chandragupta, that you treat this marriage as one only as a matter of political expedience, and to never make her your principal wife or to pay any heed to her words on any matter. It is likely that a child born of her will not be a suitable candidate for your heir, and so you must marry a more appropriate woman in future. <br>You have married two women already. Have you also assessed them for being non-pretentious? I received both in Brahma marriage – the form of marriage that arises from the desire of the groom, bride and bride’s parents alike. Thus they will know to not attempt to interfere with my work in any way … on the other hand, Durdhara will consider herself to be your creditor, and you, in a bid to win her affections, will open your own mind to her influence. Keep heed to observe if this is to happen, and when it does, avoid it.]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/rough/5/durdhara_marriage.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/rough/5/durdhara_marriage.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2024 21:05:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[first_steps]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>And thus Magadha fell. Alongside the announcement of Durdhara’s marriage to Chandragupta, the minister surrendered and agreed to officiate the marriage as the chief priest. The neutral parties in Magadha agreed to support the minister in their surrender, the few lone forts that held out were captured and their leaders executed. Panduka and Kaivarta attempted to flee, are captured at Pataliputra’s city border.<br>Chanakya immediately makes counter-arrangements in case the Greeks exploit this opportunity to gain influence in the North-West. Rewards kings who supported, immediately secures funds, security, tax cuts for reconstruction and infrastructure building (Uttarapatha, cities destroyed by the Magadhan expansion, cities destroyed by wars with the Greeks), arranges transfer of Megasthenes and Thera to Pataliputra where they cannot be rescued. Resettlement and division of Greek mercenaries. Clearing large swathes of Dandaka, hires large quantities of cheap fighting forces from the Dandakaranya natives who are now displaced to the replace lost forces – they will be resettled into civilized society and trained over the next few years. Already identified factions in Magadha disloyal to Chandragupta and execute them/resettle them in Kalinga depending on precise loyalties. Spies reporting from kingdoms in Chandragupta’s region of influence. Kings told openly that Chandragupta has spies in their state to show dominance, keep them scared to conspire – but to protect kings’ honor, “we’re not spying on you, they’re just there to keep an eye on this other guy, but their identity must remain secret”. Ashwamedha begins.<br>At the Ashwamedha Yajna, Mathurans hesitant about ruling from Magadha, which has been viewed as the enemy. Chanakya: Mathura, Ujjain and Ayodhya are rightful seats of commerce and urban life because their cities support great economies, Kishkinda and Ujjain are rightful seats of metallurgy because of their great metal deposits, Malabar, Saurashtra, Sindhu, Anga is the rightful seat for oceanic trade because it is on the coast, Malabar is the rightful seat for steel-making because of the winds in the area, The Chola coast is the rightful center for shipbuilding for it faces many resourceful lands worthy of exploration, Mathura and Ayodhya are temple towns for the great men who’ve lived in these cities. Similarly if the purpose of government is to provide security to its people and Magadha is the location of greatest military strength at this present time, then that makes Magadha the rightful seat of government. Government is but one small aspect of a nation, alongside these very many economic activities I just listed, no more “important” than any of them. Surely you do not hold a kshatriya’s job to be superior to your own? The only difference is that while these other industries create, government has the power both to protect and to destroy. The latter is what lead to the demonization of Magadha. Power corrupts.<br>Chanakya to Chandragupta: I worry about my decision to rule from Magadha. Until then I have received only praise and adulation from Brahmins at Taxila, Mathura, etc. but ever since then people have been far more reserved. I worry, because I believe that men should put themselves in good company, and my decision contradicts this, even if for sufficiently better cause. Should we move the capital to Ayodhya? Changing now would make us look indecisive. If we were to rule from Ayodhya we should have made a display of victory over Magadha, marching royal plunder and prisoners to Ayodhya and so on. Changing now would only spread dissatisfaction, among both Magadhans and Aryavartans.<br>
<br>Agenda

<br>Rebuilding and development of cities, roads, temples, universities, sanghas, other infrastructure

<br>Rebuilding of cities – Chanakya is reviewing zoning plans. Discards into the fire an artistic painting (because the dude is useless) and an overtly detailed description (because the dude is a control-freak). Megasthenes suggests Greek architecture. Chanakya: the Greeks do not understand efficiency. They are second only to the Persians in terms of wasteful and lavish displays of nobility.
<br>Renovating the Uttarapatha: widening, set up of supply depots, founding of hotels and resting towns, planting of shade trees
<br>Taking loans from banks, especially in Mathura, Ayodhya


<br>Assimilation: creation of royal insignia, coinage, offices, etc.
<br>Royal security: elimination of enemies, palace security, etc.
<br>Economic reforms and financial innovations
<br>Zoning and infrastructural reforms and innovations
<br>Military reforms and innovations
<br>Sanskritization of Magadha
<br>Territorial expansion into the South

 <br>Chandragupta Maurya uncertain. Chanakya: “A proud man can be won through professing loyalty, a greedy man can be won with money, A stupid man can be won through propaganda. But a scholar is won by the truth, and only by the truth. My hope is that from my education you have become the latter. So I will not give you a pep talk, for that would be an insult to my own teaching, I will speak to you only the truth.” Gita style: “I’m fighting on the side of invaders whom I’ve always considered barbarians – and against men whom I’ve regarded as my brothers. … And in the end, I will rule from the very city from which this nation was destroyed?” “They’re fighting for what is wrong, these guys are fighting for what is right.” “I’m expanding the territory of Magadha…” The plan. I’m merely the son of a merchant, am I not meddling in matters far beyond my level? That is an excuse for inaction …<br>Who’s our friend and who’s our foe? Was it with the army of Punjab and the Yaudheyas that we won this war? The Greeks and Persians? The Scythians? The vassal kings? Or Magadha itself? No, we manipulated them all, used them all for our victory. Some of them will benefit from this manipulation, that makes us their friends. Some of them will lose, that makes us their victors (Arthashastra quote 7.8 end). But fundamentally, this is a victory of one idea over another: of Vedic philosophy, the philosophy of wealth creation and creating the most of it possible, over Magadhi philosophy, the philosophy that gains can only be had by causing harm to another. The victory of the culture of learning and enlightenment, over the culture of darkness where whatever the king does is justified.<br>Thera, Megasthenes, are they our guests or our prisoners? The Greeks: are they our allies or enemies? For that matter, the bordering kings: are they our allies or enemies? Both. Also applies to merchants and cartelizing. Do you not feel any sense of being torn, etc.? Why would I be torn? It is not a difficult problem. That there are benefits and costs to every decision is not new to me, and this problem needn’t be solved every time it is encountered – mathematicians solved it centuries ago, with the theory of subtraction. Should a woman cry every time she purchases coriander in the market because she has to pay a price for it? Was she not already aware of it before? There is no joy to be had in solving the same problem multiple times.<br>Some people thank and celebrate, some people curse because their relatives died in war. Chanakya is unaffected, because this does not affect the truth. “When I decided on this war, did I not know that wars cause people to die? Why would their crying affect me? And when I had decided to liberate India from Nanda and the Persians, did I not know that this liberation would be good? If the consequence was known, there should be no regret when it is realized.”]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/rough/5/friend_foe.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/rough/5/friend_foe.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2024 12:28:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[last_amazon]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>I’m embarrassed I did not make the connection sooner. You are Samba. The traitor of Mathura. You wished to reveal this to me because you know I am suspicious of your loyalties, and you believe this will lead me to trust you more. <br>Not precisely. I wished to reveal to you my reasons for opposing you in your rise to power. You were interfering in my own plans for the Sanskritization of Magadha. You think the Sanskritization of Magadha, unified India wouldn’t have happened without you? Without Chandragupta? They were in of my plans. <br>You spent forty years in government, and had nothing to show for it. I achieved in 10 years a goal that you were utterly unable to make any progress towards in 40 years. What do you have to show for it, besides sacrificing vast populations to please the Nandas? <br>I made arrangements for all the other Shurasena dynasties, etc. What about the non-royals? You think you could have achieved what you did without me? How do you think Gandhara managed to stay independent? You believe it’s because of Gandhara’s policy of neutrality? When Mahapadma wished to expand into Gandhara I had him assassinated, because I didn’t want the lone remaining home of civilization to be destroyed. You have achieved great things, indeed. <br>Chanakya: I wish you and I could be friends. And not in your perverted sense. Friends are supposed to be people you trust. My perverted sense? You trust your friends, but they can’t trust you. To you, friends are food. At least I am upfront about my manipulation. … If you and I are so alike though, that means we cannot trust each other.<br>What will you do? You not commit the sin of Brahmahatya. The maximum punishment I prescribe for a Brahmin is to cut off the right hand. I will not insult you by pretending that will deter you in any of your goals. Guards, take him to Rajagriha. Imprison him in the highest-security cell of Ajatashatru’s dungeon. He will be adequately nourished and be provided basic comforts, he will not be subject to any torture. Most importantly, he will be permitted as many blank palm-leaves upon his request as is reasonable, and will be permitted to privately transmit and receive messages on such manuscripts without restriction.]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/rough/5/spoiler.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/rough/5/spoiler.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2024 21:10:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[6 Dakṣiṇapatha Kāṇḍa]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>Chanakya says, indeed those interpretations will be true, if you abdicate to Shravanabelagola. Chandragupta stays silent. Chandragupta, do you believe that I killed your wife? No, says Chandragupta. Such is the nature of the mind, says Chanakya. A rational mind has the strength to prevent a known untruth from affecting one’s beliefs, but not one’s emotions. I apologize for disappointing you, Professor. You know I don’t like apologies. But disappoint, Chandragupta? Chandragupta, my most favorite student, you have created an unprecedent golden age in the history of all India, the largest empire the world has ever seen, administered word-for-word based on my teachings, nothing short of a heaven for great minds and merchants. You think that there is any evil you could do that could negate that? I see that your mind is set, thus there is no point in convincing you to stay and do a job that you no longer enjoy. I too do not enjoy the world of administration. And as you will no longer be emperor, convincing you of the fallacies of religion is no longer worth my time.<br>Chanakya is worried of what will happen of the Mauryavamsha – will the man whom I set about to Sanskritize Magadha, will his own dynasty end up Magadhizing Aryavarta?

 <br>Chandragupta has weird dreams and talks about them with Durdhara. Chandragupta laughs them off at first, but Durdhara insists he speaks with her Jain teacher, Bhadrabahu. Cāṇakya forbids it, says they don’t mean anything.<br>Durdhara collapses in the middle of her meal in the room with other women. All the women knew the protocol in such a situation, Thera calls the doctor and surgeon and asked to alert the king and prime minister. Chanakya puts the palace on highest level emergency lockdown, especially the royal kitchen. and says if surgeon absent bring surgical instrument, optionally anesthesia, urgent. Surgeon is unconscious, Chanakya tells everyone to move as far as possible, asks Thera and Pavitra to be the midwives and to lay a blanket down, restrain her and keep her clean (be quiet) if her mouth foams. Stop shaking the body. Body? Operates on her himself and removes the child, gives it to Pavitra to clean. Bring the from the breastfeeding women’s chamber the cleanest-looking woman who doesn’t have a cold, guarded by the imperial guard. Sanitize a bedroom to quarantine the child and the breastfeeding mother.<br>Rest of the imperial guard, accompany myself and the emperor to the kitchen. The women’s chamber must remain sealed and disarm them. … Chanakya interrogates etc.<br>Rumors that Chanakya was responsible for Durdhara’s death. Image of him going around with her blood on his hands didn’t help. Also got all other influences out of the way? Not looking good for Chanakya.<br>Chanakya tells Chandragupta how he’ll squash the rumours: he knows that the minister for chariots is a bad guy, and he’s kept him around for situations like this, since chariots matter very little anyway. He’ll get the minister for chariots drunk with a confidante, that confidante will then spread rumours blablabla<br>The conspiracy theory about me killing Durdhara will then be seen with disgust … Professor, are you sane? Chanakya raised an eyebrow. Forgive me, Professor Chanakya, but I must ask: did you kill my wife? Chanakya stayed silent for a long time. “It pains me, Chandragupta, that you believe me to be so stupid or amoral that the first solution I would think of is murder. If I wished to eliminate Durdhara’s influence on you, I would have attempted the following tactics: I would have prescribed the cooks to prepare her food in excessive oil and ghee to tarnish her beauty and thereby her influence on you. I would have sent dancers to seduce Bhadrabahu in order to ruin his reputation, or spread rumours to such effect. I would have held a conference with myself, you and Durdhara and spun poetic essays to reach a resolution, or such a conference between myself, Durdhara and Bhadrabahu. I would have sent you on your conquests of Vidisha and Kalinga to firstly remove her direct influence on you and to directly control the administration at Pataliputra for that period, and two to weaken your relationship with her, or for the cause that you may find a new wife in those countries. I would not kill her, and especially not when she is pregnant with your only heir.” … “You are upset that in a time for mourning, I am speaking on matters of such practical relevance rather than attempting to say something pleasing to you. … it is said that I am cunning, that I manipulate people. But I don’t manipulate people any more than other people do. Merely, I recognize what manipulation is, I recognize most of human behaviour for what it is: an exercise in signalling and manipulation. I am successful, because with this clarity of thought, about what manipulation is, about what my goals are, I am able to use this manipulation to effectively achieve those goals. I do not wish to manipulate you, that is why I don’t behave as per prescribed social rituals around you.” Chandragupta: “Could you, nonetheless, say something that would console me?” “Chandragupta … I have made no secret out of my dislike for Durdhara’s naivety and such. But … ” And so for the first time, Chanakya lied to Chandragupta]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/rough/6/durdhara_death.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/rough/6/durdhara_death.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2024 20:31:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[southern_campaign]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Chandragupta notices Chanakya is not interested in the administration of Pataliputra anymore, and takes it as proof of Dream 11 (“young bulls laboring”). Chanakya encourages Chandragupta to begin his Southern campaign.<br>Chanakya doesn’t want to waste his time on travel, so doesn’t accompany Chandragupta on his Southern campaign. I’ll settle in Taxila. People think there’s a rift between him and Chandragupta. Thera asks him. Chanakya complains about (Greek? non-Brahmins?) people basing people’s motivations on incidents that occurred in their lives, instead of ideologies actually motivated by the truth. Even for people not motivated by the truth, the most common motivations are pretentiousness, tribalism and attachment to stories. If someone bases their beliefs on personal experience, it is an example of the third, and a scholar ought to avoid such stupidity.<br>Thera asks Chanakya: This great empire that you’ve created, are you not attached to it? Chanakya: one should not be attached to wild beasts, scientific theories, or kings. There might come a day when you find them to be wrong, and you may need to remove them. Thera asks Chanakya: you started with no resources, and went to establishing an empire that rules the entire Eastern half of the world. This is the culmination of your efforts. You have created a great empire, unified the East … how much of the economy do you estimate? Half. With such flattery, I must suspect you to be a vishakanya. In any case, of course I am proud. I simply do not attach much meaning to such symbolism. I am present in places where my presence adds value. I was with Chandragupta when I needed him to do the impossible. Ordinary military expeditions do not require me, regardless of their symbolism as a milestone.<br>Also being away from Pataliputra will give some time for get throne lusters to rear their heads while Chandragupta was away in the South, especially when a rift is believed to exist between Cāṇakya and Candragupta. ]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/rough/6/southern_campaign.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/rough/6/southern_campaign.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2024 20:36:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[elements]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>“THE ELEMENTS OF SOVEREIGNITY”<br>PREFIX<br><br>in: THE KAUTILYA LECTURES<br>Delivered initially in [date:-336|magadha] at Takṣaśilā, Gandhāra to the following students:<br>
<br>Apratimaujas a Brāhmaṇa of Gokula, Śūrasena

<br>Candragupta a kṣatriya of Pāṭaliputra, Magadha
<br>Śrībhānu a kṣatriya of Kuṇḍagrāma, Vṛji
<br>Transcribed later from memory by Śrībhānu for the benefit of the Yavana girl Tara.<br>Edited and organized at the word of Professor Cāṇakya by the Yavana lady Tara.<br><br>Kaṇāda, the preceptor of the Vaiśeṣika (Reductionist) philosophy, says that the study of the Physical Sciences begins with the enumeration of the elements that comprise matter. He lists these elements as being of six types: substances, qualities, activities, generality, particularity and relationship. From this through the methods of perception and inference alone, all other laws of science can be explained.<br>Similarly, to discover the laws of the science of government, one must list the elements of sovereignty.<br>Uśanas says that the king is the sovereign. Bhāradvāja says that it is the minister. Viśālākṣa says that it is the country that is sovereign. Parāśara and Kauṇapadanta say that it is the army and the fort – my own preceptor is sympathetic to this stance. Pisuna says that it is the treasury – I too adopted this stance in my early days.<br>But none of these can be correct. In the game of chess, victory and loss depend entirely on the capture of the king; not so in real wars, for a king too can be sacrificed by a minister to win a war. The replacement or death of a minister is not as great a tragedy as the loss of a country to an enemy. The country alone cannot be sovereign, as we care about who rules it. And as for the army, the fort, the treasury – if any of these were the sole guarantor of sovereignty, the soldier who guarded the treasury doors would be truly powerful.<br>I will speak, more generally, of how order is established.<br>The guard of the treasury is loyal to the king because he thinks, “If I steal from the treasury, I will be punished when my theft is exposed by the auditor”, and furthermore, that if he attempts to conspire with the auditor, the auditor will think “The guard may be a spy for the king, this may be a ploy to test my honesty”.<br>If the guard and the auditor were of one mind, they could unite and conspire to steal the king’s wealth; if all the soldiers of a king were of one mind, they could unite and refuse to work for the king; if the vassals of an emperor were of one mind, they could unite and overthrow the emperor. But divided, they may be ruled.<br>I shall provide, for the purpose of understanding, other examples of such phenomena as they occur.<br>Prices are such a phenomena. Sellers, if they were capable of conspiring with each other, could set prices that were as high as they desired; however, if such a conspiracy were attempted, a seller would then think “the other seller may be a traitor, he may reduce his prices slightly one day and take all my clients for himself and increase his revenue manyfold”, and likewise the other seller. Or they may think “the other seller thinks as I do, and if I am capable of betrayal, so is he”. And so even the slightest rumour of dissension breaks the cartel that does not punish its traitors.<br>Language is such a phenomena. Scythians, if they could all will alike, could speak the Civilized Tongue and consequently speak and think with clarity as we do, and the effects of doing so would be beneficial to their economy. Yet each Scythian may think “If I alone start speaking Civilized Tongue, none of my colleagues would understand me”, and there is thus no cause for any one Scythian to speak the Civilized Tongue, even if there is reason for all Scythians together to do so.<br>And sovereignty is such a phenomena. Even when a conspiracy against the king is profitable – whether in the treasury, or in the army, or in the court, or by supporting enemy kings, each member must think “this conspiracy may be a ploy by the king to test me, and even if it is not, other members of it may choose to betray me for profit, thus I should betray it for profit first”.<br>Such is the nature of man: every decision is made by the will of one man, not by many together.<br>Thus it is a fallacy to make statements like “The rich do such things because it benefits them” or “The Brāhmaṇas do such things because it benefits them”. For while the behaviour of individuals may serve their interests, the behaviour of groups lacking in unity seldom does.<br>And thus the art of statecraft is the art of making alliances, so that it becomes profitable for each of its members to be loyal to the king, even if it would not have been profitable if they were lacking in unity.<br>Thus there are seven elements of sovereignty: the king, the minister, the country, the treasury, the army, the fort, and the ally, and the successful exercise of statecraft lies in binding these elements together through the latter element.<br>“Professor,” asks Apratimaujas, “Would this be a correct summary of your teaching? To exercise governance, it is necessary to have command over a large number of people, for if you have command only over a small number of people, they will have no cause to be loyal to you?”<br>“Continue under that assumption,” Cāṇakya directs.<br>“How, then, is an alliance ever defeated, or a new state ever established? It seems to me that in the absence of other allies being loyal, an ally has no cause to be loyal, and the same applies to each of those allies, and so on. It appears to be the same problem as that of teaching Scythians the Civilized Tongue.”<br>“I will say three things,” says Cāṇakya, “Firstly, kings may not have successfully instituted such a system as would instil loyalty, and such vulnerabilities may be exploited. Second, it is possible to ally with an existing powerful state against another powerful state, or to take loans, so it is not necessarily the case that you start with having no one as your ally. Third, there are methods to create loyalty among large numbers of people at once. But more generally, the question you’re raising is known as the problem of war.”]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/specials/lectures/elements.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/specials/lectures/elements.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 20:53:22 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[PREFIX]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>Transcribed later from memory by Śrībhānu for the benefit of the Yavana girl Tara.<br>Edited and organized at the word of Professor Cāṇakya by the Yavana lady Tara.<br><br>The security of a state depends on the loyalties of its elements of sovereignty: of the king, the minister, the treasury, the army, the fort, the country and the allies. There are numerous means of securing such loyalties, and there are numerous means for them to be secured or seized by the enemy. This game played between a king and his enemy is termed war.<br>A formal declaration does not mark the start of war, similarly a peace treaty does not mark its end, only that of open war. War is perpetual, in one form or the other, and a king cannot rest even after he has completed a conquest, for the continued possession of an article requires continued active participation in such war as it persists.<br>It is then asked: how can such mighty forces – a great army, great wealth, a great population and country, large numbers of secure fortresses, foreign kings, the intellect of ministers – be made loyal to the will of a king alone?<br>Bhāradvāja says the king must be like a lion in the forest: even though he is small in number, he is far too powerful to be defeated by animals that are more numerous.<br>Parāśara says he must be like a mahout controlling an elephant: even though he is weaker than the elephant, he is able to control it by virtue of his position and tools.<br>But these are not correct: a king need not be the mightiest of his country in either dimension of masculine strength: intellectual, physical or otherwise; indeed, such strengths may be suited to other economic pursuits than kingship. Nor may a country be compared to an elephant, as unlike an elephant it contains men with intellect and technology equal or superior to that of the king.<br>Thus, I say he must be like a sluice in a canal – or like any other machine.<br>“I believe that control over a large army requires a larger army,” says Pabbata, “And likewise for a treasury, a country, a fort, an ally, and an intellect. Is this not so?”<br>No, as such demands would be infinite – even if you secure frontier articles in this way, the capital would still remain unsecured, as the chaotic political history of Magadha attests. And although the Persians claim that they have achieved stability by seizing powerful articles away from the countries they conquer, this alone cannot guarantee stability, as the king still assigns these articles to his subordinates; furthermore such centralization is an obstacle to mobility; as a result, Persia is weak at fighting on multiple fronts.<br>Much as a small sluice controls a far more powerful current, much as a lever controls the heavy projectiles loaded onto a catapult, much as a switch controls the flow of activity to a mill from a load raised by a water-wheel; similarly large elements may be controlled by small ones placed strategically and with intrigue.<br>Such small elements are termed spies.<br>Spies are secret by default, and are not allowed to admit their role or source of income to even those close to them – why?<br>“Because wise counsel lies in not revealing what one has determined to carry out,” says Candragupta.<br>The goal of spies is to ensure loyalty among the elements of sovereignty. To this end, they carry out the following three types of operations:<br>
<br>gathering intelligence on and influencing the opinions and plans of ministers, officials, army, forts, country and allies
<br>scouting and affecting the same of an ally, enemy or neutral state
<br>conducting covert operations against an enemy
<br>A spy may allure various members to betray the king and test their loyalties in this way. Such allurement may be in the form of persuasion, bribery, threats or deceit.<br>
<br>Allurement by bribery is the most crucial as it is such methods that are used by enemies most frequently: bribery includes bribery by wealth, titles and positions of power, sexual favours and other incentives.
<br>Allurement by persuasion is second most crucial: a spy may speak ill of the king in confidence to the subject, and if the latter agrees, he may be disposed from his position as he is seen as susceptible to being turned by persuasion.
<br>Allurement by threats is crucial to maintain discipline among officials and the army: those who successfully resist such threats and report them to the king risking their lives may be heralded for their courage without making it publicly known that the threat was an intelligence operation.
<br>Allurement by deceit may be done to prevent subjects from having their superstitions exploited by tricks and contravariances used by the enemy.
<br>Thus the firmness, honesty, courage and intelligence of subjects may be tested by spies through the respective methods of gathering intelligence.<br>Spies may also conduct simpler listening and propaganda operations to the same end.<br>Likewise for spies scouting and affecting foreign countries and their articles.<br>Covert operations conducted by spies sabotage one or more of the enemy’s elements of sovereignty.<br>
<br>Sabotage of the king and minister is assassination, kidnapping, seduction of the queen, disruption of councils and other offenses against the person.
<br>Sabotage of forts and armies is infiltration; these involve replacing army men and merchandise with inferior quality or traitorous substitutes, and of smuggling weapons into forts.
<br>Sabotage of the treasury is looting.
<br>Sabotage of the country is the destruction or seizure of farm and mine produce, poisoning of streams and livestock, and the obstruction of roads.
<br>Sabotage of the ally is obstructing or falsifying messages sent and received by the enemy.
<br>The following applies to all kinds of spying operations: just as a chariot may be pulled by an excess of horses tied in such a way that the vehicle is still functional when one of them is slain, at least three spies should be issued independently towards one goal without being revealed to each other, and their reports should be checked to agree – this way, spies can be made to spy on one another, and their loyalties can be checked.<br>Similarly, the spies and the espionage institutions should not be known to each other. This is to prevent the formation of conspiracies against the government, and to prevent captured spies from revealing information that compromises other spies or operations of the government.<br>Similarly, spies should be trained to use special pre-defined symbols – if their tasks are sufficiently generic, they should be trained to communicate in cipher.<br>Spies must be recruited from all walks of life. Those in all four stages of life – students, householders, recluses and ascetics – may all be recruited. Of chief importance are merchants, prostitutes, cooks and such servants, respected heroes and colleagues of the subject being spied on.<br>Criminals are particularly useful as spies, especially when it is not known to themselves that they are being used as spies. Such spies may also be used in situations where it is necessary to make a show of executing the spy after the operation is conducted.<br>Finally, a king may keep a known traitor, corrupt official, criminal or incompetent in his government for several reasons, including: pooling of intelligence about other traitors from those who associate with the known traitor, centrally manipulating such other traitors through the known traitor, use as a scapegoat in public relations disasters, use as fodder in various operations.]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/specials/lectures/spies.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/specials/lectures/spies.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 20:57:51 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[war]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>“THE CAUSES FOR WAR”<br>PREFIX<br><br>in: THE KAUTILYA LECTURES<br>Delivered initially in [date:-336|magadha] at Takṣaśilā, Gandhāra to the following students:<br>

<br>Śrībhānu a kṣatriya of Kuṇḍagrāma, Vṛji
<br>Transcribed later from memory by Śrībhānu for the benefit of the Yavana girl Tara.<br>Edited and organized at the word of Professor Cāṇakya by the Yavana lady Tara.<br><br>“What is the objective of war?” asks Cāṇakya.<br>“To acquire more power,” Pabbata answers.<br>“And what such powers are acquired by war?” asks Cāṇakya.<br>“The power to tax,” suggests Pabbata.<br>“To improve the conquered country by enforcing security, eradicating wild tribes and such,” suggests Daṇḍaśarman.<br>“Or by creating academies and granting uncultivated lands to Brāhmaṇas for cultivation,” suggests Pāṇini.<br>“Or by improving the judicial system and outlawing wicked practices in the conquered country,” suggests Candragupta.<br>A conqueror may possess many goals, including taxation, enactment of better laws in the conquered land, protection or formation of trade networks, or control over locations of strategic importance such as to protect one’s country from invasion or to clear a path for one’s army to conquer the country beyond the conquered country. For all these goals, the conqueror requires the loyalties of men in the enemy’s country; thus in general terms the goal of the conqueror is to be able to govern the conquered country.<br>Sometimes this loyalty amounts to accepting the conquered king as a vassal, or in some cases even deposing him entirely, and governing the conquered country as a province of one’s own. But sometimes all that is desired is a trade treaty, or the protection of trade routes, or the installation of a ruler more friendly to the conqueror’s interests.<br>Much as one starts with the definition of the elements to explain the laws of science, one must start from the definition of war to explain the tactics of war. The term war invokes images of battles and expeditions, but the definition is far more general. For example, it also includes a coup or a civil war, or a war fought through deception alone.<br>The efforts taken to acquire some article in the sense of exercising right over it – a country, a route, a fort, port or strategic position, a water source, some loot, slaves, a woman or several, honour and glory – is termed war.<br>Some of these causes are just; others are not.<br>Those that impede such efforts are termed enemies.<br>“I have heard the term Cakravarti used to refer to an emperor who rules all of the civilized world,” says Candragupta, “Is that a just cause for war as well?”<br>Cāṇakya declines to answer that question.<br>I shall now discuss the means of waging war.<br>“Suppose that I wished to acquire the country of Avanti for the right to tax it,” says Cāṇakya, “At the very least, I would need to send a messenger to their tax collectors to send their taxes to me instead of to their king. What would happen then?”<br>“You’d be laughed at,” says Pabbata.<br>“Indeed, for they have no reason to comply. Suppose that I threatened to execute them if they didn’t comply, or if I offered them a salary to comply. What would happen then?”<br>“You’d still be laughed at, if you are known to have no means of following up on your word. But if you do follow up on your word, the king of Ujjain would capture and punish you for your crime.”<br>“Or at least, they will punish whichever agents I send to carry out these activities. So the king of Ujjain is doing something I do not wish him to do. What do I do when I wish to change someone’s behaviour to my liking?”<br>“The doctrine of sāma-dāma-daṇḍa-bheda (persuasion, purchase, punishment, deceit),” Śrībhānu recalled. “You will employ these means to cause the king of Ujjain to do your bidding.”<br>Pabbata smirks. “Good luck with that. The king of Ujjain is a viceroy of Magadha.”<br>“These discussions are theoretical,” says Cāṇakya sternly. “Can you tell me which of these four methods I will use, and how?”<br>“You could hardly persuade the king or the tax collectors to pay you taxes,” says Pāṇini, “Bribing someone to give you money hardly sounds sensible. I suppose you could deceive them by bribing some cart drivers and border guards—”<br>“Recall that I am not merely attempting a one-time plunder,” says Cāṇakya, “I wish to have the right to tax the land, as recognized by its people, so that I can do so unopposed and peacefully.”<br>“You would punish the king of Ujjain,” said Daṇḍaśarman. “Or threaten him with punishment.”<br>One method of such punishment is assassination. Indeed, this is what has been constantly occurring in Magadha as we speak. Yet, the king may be too well-guarded to easily assassinate, or the king’s ministers may have decision-making power, and they may not care so much about the health of the king as they do of the health of the country. Or I may be worried of the king attempting a counter-assassination on myself, and for a king endowed with wealth, that may have a greater chance of success.<br>Thus I wish to harass the country of Avanti in order to have them do my bidding.<br>What is the best way to harass a country?<br>There are two forms of harassment: generic harassment, with the understanding that it will stop if they submit to my will, or targeted harassment, that specifically punishes the action that I wish to forbid. The latter is preferable if I only wish to conquer a portion of their country, or if I wish to force them into accepting a treaty on trade and such; the former is preferable if I wish to conquer their entire country.<br>Generic harassment takes many forms: assassinations and kidnappings of important officials, robbing treasuries, capturing territories other than the desired one as hostage, destructive acts such as burning countries, plundering cities and poisoning water sources, blocking of trade routes and food supplies.<br>Targeted harassment involves battles. Battle may emerge between the army I send to rob their treasuries and the army they send in defence of it, and then such battles may escalate as each side sends reinforcements. Such battles are to be avoided, as they are unplanned – instead, the conqueror must plan in advance and send an army of the size and composition that will eventually be needed. Secretive methods may also be employed to aid a battle.<br>When the costs the conqueror imposes through these methods exceeds the costs of surrender for the defender, the conqueror wins.<br>An expedition should only be undertaken if its expected profit – from gathered taxes and loot, concern for the welfare of the conquered people, precautionary cause, strategic cause – exceeds its costs.<br>Thus, a war whose outcome is known in advance to both sides should never be fought.<br>Thus, all warfare is deception.<br>To harass a country – plunder its cities, burn its fields, capture its leaders, and so on – one needs to place an army in the midst of that country. Routes are too easily blocked, and mobilizing armies is costly and time-consuming, thus the necessity to establish or capture forts. Similarly, a defender needs forts to mobilize one’s army more easily, and to be able to pinch direct attacks in the centre of the country. For one large lion can be fought, but it is much harder to fight a pack of wolves that surrounds you on all sides.<br>A defender may judge that instead of retreating to a fort, he may defeat the attacker’s army in battle before it reaches the fort. This may be advised if the defender can find a location for battle that favours him, such as a river crossing or certain terrain, as these act as forts of their own sorts. But forts are preferred, as they can be designed by men to function as desired, much as agriculture is desired to hunting and gathering fruits in the forest. Thus the conqueror should also establish military camps.<br>“I will pose to you a question,” says Cāṇakya, “Why don’t conquerors simply focus on capturing the capital through an assassination, rather than make extensive efforts to capture bordering cities and forts?”<br>“Kings tend to be well-guarded?” Daṇḍaśarman suggests.<br>“Pabbata,” asks Cāṇakya, “What would happen if I were to assassinate Dhanānanda?”<br>“You would quickly be executed by Sakadala, and Augraseniya would be appointed Emperor,” Pabbata answers.<br>“What if, instead of assassinating Dhanānanda, I entered Magadha territory and somehow raised a local army and laid siege to Pāṭaliputra?”<br>“Then the surrounding forts loyal to the emperor would surround and destroy your army.”<br>“Those are similar outcomes,” Apratimaujas observes, “If you attack the emperor, his allies within the palace will destroy you; if you attack the palace, the armies of the city will attack you; if you attack the city, the armies of the country will attack you; if you attack the country, the armies of the vassals will attack you; and if you attack the empire, the armies of the allies will attack you.”<br>“So one must know where to attack from,” Candragupta considers, “Weighing the quickness of a direct attack against the unopposed nature of an attack from the outside?”<br>“Not exactly,” says Cāṇakya, “An attack from the inside must also fight all those who attempt to stop him, as must an attack from the outside. However, an attack from the inside may cause the conqueror to be more easily surrounded, and thus poses a strategic disadvantage in terms of positioning. Can anyone state the more general point I am trying to demonstrate?”<br>“That the conqueror’s victory depends on acquiring the loyalties of each of the defender’s elements of sovereignty,” says Apratimaujas, “The allies’ loyalties depend on their belief as to who will emerge victorious; yet your victory depends on the allies’ loyalties.”<br>“It is akin to the problem of teaching Scythians the Civilized Tongue,” says Candragupta.<br>“It is akin to a self-fulfilling prophecy,” says Pāṇini.<br>Indeed, the art of war is the art of commanding the loyalties of the elements of sovereignty. There are many methods to do acquire the loyalties of the enemy’s elements.<br>If the conqueror already possesses a greater degree of sovereignty than the defender – such as through a sufficiently larger army, wealthier treasury, larger or superior country, or a king and minister that govern with greater intellect – then that alone is sufficient to acquire the elements, as the enemy is aware that an attempt to oppose the conqueror can be punished effectively by the conqueror.<br>If the conqueror is starting with little, then he must employ many cunning methods to acquire these elements. For example, he may pretend to have acquired an ally to acquire another ally, and vice versa to acquire the first ally. Or he may sow dissension within the enemy’s country to weaken the enemy’s command over his own elements, thus allowing even a weak king to conquer the country. Or he may take the support of a new ally entirely.<br>Such methods are diverse and require creativity, they cannot simply be taught through lecture. I will eventually, through the means of various games, teach you to independently suggest such methods when necessary.<br>A particular method to create self-fulfilling prophecies is the manipulation of the enemy’s morale. This is the purpose of motivating an army through speeches, of demoralizing the enemy’s army, of slaying commanders, of planting flags on fortresses, of writing declarations of war and independence, of fabricating bad omens, of creating false genealogies and prophecies, of seeking verbal endorsement from distinguished Brāhmaṇas, and of performing the _Aśvamedha ritual.<br>No individual soldier needs to be motivated by the speech, yet the collective of all soldiers is motivated by it, as each individual soldier will think, “As this king has given this speech, all my compatriots will be more loyal to him, and thus he has a greater chance of succeeding, and when he does succeed, I shall be rewarded if I am loyal to him now”, and all his compatriots think the same. Similarly, no enemy soldier needs to be superstitious for a bad omen to demoralize him, for he need only think “All my compatriots will be demoralized by this bad omen, thus the enemy will win, thus I will benefit from betraying my king”, and all his compatriots think the same.<br>This is also why houses are built in accordance with the principles of Vāstu, for each man thinks “If I purchase a house not in accordance with such principles, no one will buy it from me”, and even if no one man believes in these principles, men will believe in it as a collective.<br>I will make some comments on how such methods may be executed successfully.<br>The pronouncement of inspiring speeches can be compared to flirtations between a man and an unchaste woman. Each soldier is afraid to immediately proclaim his loyalty by crying “Victory to the Great King!”, as his compatriots may not share this feeling, and indeed they will not, as each of them thinks the same. Instead, he may express interest in the king’s words, put on an expression of high morale, breath and stand in an inspired manner, and applaud the king with a cry or through gestures, in that order, all as he observes similar signals from his compatriots. The process may also be aided by taking in confidence beforehand particular soldiers of decent repute to cry “Victory to the Great King!” in order to pressure their compatriots to do the same.<br>The key to turning loyalties is to make oneself distinguished in some way; it does not matter which way. For example, a relative of the king, the minister or general, a subjugated house or vassal state, an imprisoned or exiled king of an extinguished line all have a greater chance of conquering a country than does an ordinary man. People are also more likely to follow men distinguished by their wealth, scholarship, high birth and fame. That is why when a prince of a king may even conquer the capital directly, while an external king would likely fail in this mission unless he appoints a local governor as his vassal.<br>One way to avoid betrayal, whether intentional or by such tactics, is to associate with allies of good repute, such as ancient noble lines that will defend the honour of their word with their lives, or with mercenary clans of good repute, or with close and reliable friends with character that can be personally appraised.<br>Similarly to prevent attacks on his own army’s morale, a king must train his soldiers and other government servants to a protocol. This is known as “discipline”.<br>When attacking a disciplined army, a conqueror must expose them to unexpected situations that they have not been trained a protocol for.<br>Thus each possible situation must be anticipated and effective protocols must be developed to be followed in these situations.<br>To develop the best counter-play to the enemy, a king must also gather information about the enemy, such as of the size and composition of his army, and the tactics he may employ. This is ascertained with scouts and spies. For example, the composition of one’s army must reflect what is needed to oppose the other’s army, such as the use of archers against infantry, and the use of cavalry against archers; as must the fortifications and location of battle.<br>If both parties had complete knowledge of the other’s army and sent the best army to oppose it, the result would be heavy bloodshed on both sides.<br>Thus all warfare is deception.<br>Discipline also has its disadvantages, as following orders may lead men off a cliff. Thus, per the needs of the situation, a king may employ mercenaries, or entertain his own soldiers as mercenaries by placing bounties on the achievement of certain goals, such as slaying a commander. Bounties on the achievement of greater goals, like seizing a fortress, may be offered to organized mercenary clans rather than to individual soldiers.<br>For completeness, I shall discuss the method of Dharmayuddha.<br>It is observed among some wild beasts that when they fight among themselves, they fight with their paws sheathed. Even though unsheathing their paws would allow them a greater chance to succeed, doing so will also prompt their enemy to unsheathe their paws, causing a great deal of destruction to both sides. Thus the beasts silently agree on certain rules of what is foul and what is not.<br>Similar observations can be made about pitched duels between princes.<br>Similar observations can be made about debates between scholarly Brāhmaṇas.<br>Similarly, two enemies may agree beforehand to fight on a particular battlefield at a specified time, to only bring certain weapons or an army of certain size to the fight, to obey certain rules during the battle, to surrender a predefined objective upon defeat in this battle, to not depose the defeated king but to reinstate him as ruler subject to certain acceptable conditions, and so on. Such rules are followed by clans in the interest of preserving their reputation.<br>As it is only kṣatriya warriors who may be expected to uphold such rules, armies of vast numbers cannot be raised by employing peasant soldiers in such battles. Thus such battles cannot be fought against tribes such as the Scythians that conscript entire populations into their armies. Nor can such rules be followed while fighting against Western tribes whose army compositions are vastly different from those of civilized states, or against tribes that have no reputation to uphold, or against tribes of poor reputation.<br>Following rules that your enemy doesn’t follow is suicide with extra steps.<br>Thus Kutayuddha is of great importance when fighting against barbarians.<br>As an exercise, you shall explain why states are nearly always contiguous, and what this entails for our assumptions about statecraft.]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/specials/lectures/war.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/specials/lectures/war.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 19:21:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[arjunayana]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>A speech, from Śaśigupta of Takṣaśilā to the Ārjunāyanas of Indraprastha.<br>I salute you, Vṛṣṇiman, the chief of the mighty Ārjunāyanas, the worthy claimants to the legacy of the mighty Arjuna, of the Kuru line of antiquity – the blessed of the defenders of the Kṣatriya Dharma, who are honoured for their quality that a Brāhmaṇa need not tell them twice for them to understand the truth and execute the correct action. I compliment the beauty and grandeur of your delusive chamber, the oldest of its form known in the three worlds.<br>Professor Cāṇakya has received an intimation of a military expedition against the Ārjunāyanas. He has forbidden me from disclosing to you the nature of this expedition, or its belligerents, for we must consider every possibility of betrayal – but I will say that the threat will be more serious than anything the Ārjunāyanas have ever faced in the past, and that I frankly regard it as unlikely you will be able to survive the attack without my intervention.<br>I ask that you allow me to advise you alongside your strategist Nripanjaya – I cannot leave the entire task up to you, as my informants in the enemy’s territory trust only myself and Professor Cāṇakya, who is busy in Takṣaśilā with his other students, but I do not demand any power or direct control over your armies; I ask only that you accept the information I provide you and act as per my advice.<br>I will not demand any salary from you beyond the provision for my sustenance, for I am a student of Professor Cāṇakya, and am here on his behest – he will only request his reward after the war is over, the fruits of his help are realized to you, and you have rebuilt any damages that your country suffers in the course of the war. This should relieve you of any apprehensions, for we have little to gain from deceiving you; from this alliance we desire nothing more than your trust and the defeat of our common enemy.]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/specials/letters_speeches/arjunayana.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/specials/letters_speeches/arjunayana.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 19:21:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[augraseniya_father]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>Hear, hear!<br>Hear, Kambojas! Hear, residents of the town of Avarana!<br>Our country is said to be the most beautiful of all countries in the world, its men are said to be the most noble and its women to be the most beautiful in all three worlds, and both are the most skilled in their respective arts and such pursuits – this is held by the Indians and Iranians alike, that we are the most exemplary of Āryas.<br>Yet they continue to treat our country as a commercial article for their enjoyment, as subject to their rule, not to be afforded any independence of our own.<br>Far too long has Takṣaśilā enjoyed a special autonomy under the Persians. As a result of this accord, the Gandhāras have grown closer to the Persians than they are to the Kambojas, their own brothers in blood!<br>Unacceptable! says the noble Prince Sanjaya of Takṣaśilā from whom this message is relayed to you.<br>Either the Gandhāras shall be placed under the same rule as the Kambojas are – or the Kambojas shall be elevated to the same status as the Gandhāras enjoy. No longer must the Kambojas tolerate this differential treatment from the Persians, this subjugation of our people to a distant king with whom we share few bonds.<br>Prince Sanjaya is intelligent and brave, he has the endorsement of many great scholars even as they are too afraid to pronounce their endorsement publicly. He is affected towards a Kamboja maiden, the apsara Sukeśī, and he has married her in the Gandharva style, for this he has been disowned by King Āmbhi, his father, and for this reason he has rebelled.<br>Your most blessed town has been selected by Prince Sanjaya as the location for a fort of his construction. He seeks your support in his secession from Takṣaśilā and promises you far better treatment than what you have been given by the Persians, he promises you a kingdom that has the strength to stand for interests, that is not merely at the mercy of the Persians.<br>To this end, he has already secured the support of the powerful King Puruṣottama of the Vṛṣṇis, the mightiest enemy of the Persians, and of the mighty Queen Kṛpā of the Matsyaka Scythians, whose tribe is known for having vanquished the Persians and beheaded the emperor Koorush many centuries prior. Each of these allies has been prophesied to be great conquerors and liberators, and they are the natural allies of a people of such dignity and stature as the Kambojas.<br>The residents of Avarana are directed to start building a great fort for Prince Sanjaya – directors will be dispatched to employ craftsmen, builders, guards, mercenaries and servants for this purpose. Those who co-operate with the prince will be rewarded handsomely for their efforts, both individually and via their service to a Kamboja victory – for Prince Sanjaya is not short on wealth nor on his capacity to acquire it from his enemies. And those who act as traitors to the cause of the Kambojas, who refuse to provide their labour for the Kamboja cause, will be regarded as such, and will be punished by the gods for their betrayal.<br>Rejoice, noble Kambojas! For today marks the beginning of a new era in the history of the Kambojas, an era in which we shall reclaim that glory which has been so wrongfully seized from us. Salute Prince Sanjaya, for he is the saviour that you have been awaiting, the hero of ancient prophecies.]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/specials/letters_speeches/avarna.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/specials/letters_speeches/avarna.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 19:21:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[ghrtaci]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>O Princess Ghṛtācī of the Matsyaka Scythians – whose beauty is equated by no other maiden of any race in any of the three worlds – whose auspicious birth was heralded by the great sages of the Āryas as prophetic of a great conqueror from Strīrājya and by the sages of the Western tribes as the reincarnation of the Great Queen Tahm-Rayish who vanquished the Persians.<br>This message is from an Ārya of Gandhāra who, remaining anonymous, has chosen to identify himself merely as “a well-wisher of yours”.<br>He says: Beware your friends, princess.<br>Beware of those who demand a right to your trust for they are of the same bloodline.<br>As the dynastic light of a most illustrious Scythian line, you have been taught by your family to beware your enemies – but I, who am neither your relation nor your enemy, tell you to beware of both.<br>It is foolish for you to celebrate the rise in ranks of your sister Kṛpā and the presence that she has made in Kamboja.<br>In truth, she is only seizing what is rightfully yours.<br>If this thought is too painful or offensive for you to hold, then take that as proof of my words, as proof that those you call your own have enslaved your mind even without enslaving you, that each of them use your abilities towards their ends without heed to those capacities of yours that serve your own ambitions.<br>You must prove me wrong, princess. You must prove to me, that you have not been enslaved so, as most boys and girls of our age so naively are.<br>The other Scythian tribes have pushed yours South of the Oxus River, and in your new home you are displaced by the Bāhlīkas who seek to reclaim the land that was once theirs. If your sister Kṛpā claims Kamboja for herself, then you may assume that she will take the whole of Āryāvarta for herself. You will have nowhere to go, nothing to rule, no legacy to claim.<br>You are the prophesied conqueror of all the countries East of the Sindhu river – do not allow your sister to take this title for herself. Your name is one that ought to be recited by the bards of history for as long as men’s tongues last – do not allow it to be forgotten. For prophecies are made true by your own actions, and the lazy do not have prophecies written about them.<br>Consider your options carefully and wisely, and seek out opportunities to avail, or make them yourself.]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/specials/letters_speeches/ghrtaci.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/specials/letters_speeches/ghrtaci.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 19:21:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[ghrtaci_3]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>Hear, king of Persia!<br>Hear the words of Dhanānanda the World Conqueror, who is possessed of an enormous and prosperous treasury, of secure territory with no enemies to his East but the vast seas, of an uninterrupted territory secured by an army of 3000 elephants, 2000 four-horsed chariots, 20,000 cavalry, 200,000 infantry and many incredible devices and contravariances that your people have not heard of even in fantastical tales – to whom every other king bows his head in submission out of fear for the lives of his men, the dignity of his women, the freedom of his children, the security of his finances and the continued existence of his country.<br>All around you, King of Persia, your prophets and soothsayers – not only your rivals and the rebels, but even those whom you once regarded as your well-wishers – warn of your annihilation, of the end times of your empire, and accuse that it will be brought by you.<br>Let me convey to you the wise words of the Ājīvaka philosophers of my own great country, who say that it would be foolish to blame you for such a loss, for men are but machines, that if you are prophesied for destruction, then that is your fate and there is no escape from it. For that is the inevitable consequences of your own choices, even as those choices were not truly yours. They say that you should seek solace in this fate.<br>But I say this: there are two choices available to you today, and even though you do not truly possess any faculties to make a choice by your own volition, the choice that is made for you will have a profound impact on how you are remembered by history.<br>You may seek my friendship and my goodwill – you may heed the wisdom of my kind words, then you shall know the generosity of a Magadha! Why, these petty conflicts you have with the Greeks could be resolved by the mighty king of Magadha, through my mediation, for such is my strength, such is my wealth, such is my power! I am a most desirable friend, and a most unpleasant enemy – such are the words spoken of the mighty king of Magadha in all the countries of the world.<br>But if you retain your unwanted presence in the country I claim as my own, then I fear that all the events that you dread the most – those doubts that harass your mind so intolerably, even as you attempt to suppress them, that your detractors might be speaking words of truth – will unfold before your very eyes. Your fears of being remembered in history as the emperor who gave away his country to the Sindhis and Scythians and Greeks, of having your beautiful realm ravaged by powerful armies on all sides, will become reality.<br>These are the words of the mightiest empire to have ever existed in the world – an empire that has not lost two thirds of an inch of territory in all its history, whose borders have never shrunk, whose kings have never failed to secure any land they set their eyes on; they are the words of the greatest ruler of such an empire, who is undefeated in battle, whose ambitions are great, to whom other kings come begging for mercy and largesse.]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/specials/letters_speeches/magadha_persia.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/specials/letters_speeches/magadha_persia.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 19:21:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[magadha_persia_aftermath]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>The messenger rose from his prostrated state, keeping his posture formal.<br>“There are several pieces of grave news, O Great King of Kings,” said Haxamanish solemnly, his head bowed and his body trembling. He looked toward the courtiers helplessly, seeking their advice – the most aged of them, the Emperor’s most trusted advisor Ariyawratha, gave him a subtle encouraging nod, as if instructing him to proceed with the news without excessive formality.<br>“Firstly – our most prosperous province, Gandhāra, has been invaded by the Matsyaka Queen Kṛpā, who has secured the Western parts of the province. King Āmbhi remains is loyal to us, but his court is fragmented, with his own son joining the rebels, and he is forced to invest his resources against the advances of his Eastern rivals in Hind, who, as you are aware, had rebelled again from us several years prior, with the support of the Yaudheyas, depriving us of a third of our government revenues.<br>The court was silent – not because they were fearful, or because they had no questions to raise, but because they did not know what to feel, or what to think without explicit instruction from their God-king. But the God-king Darayavaush himself remained stoic, finding himself in a more complicated situation than he had ever known.<br>It was Ariyawratha who spoke.<br>“And how have they contracted the Yaudheyas, messenger? Surely they lack the funds to do so.”<br>Haxamanish was shivering.<br>“I believe … I believe, O Great King of Kings, and do forgive me for raising such an inauspicious possibility … I believe that security of the Imperial tax collection in Hind has been breached.”<br>Darayavaush slammed his fist down in rage.<br>“Do they believe that the Empire has no funds of its own beyond an annual collection from Hind? That we are entirely reliant on a mere two provinces for our entire administration, that we will allow such a prosperous country to secede from the empire without consequence?”<br>But his words were vacuous – for all in the court knew that Hind alone contributed a third of Imperial revenue, and the treasury had not saved as much from previous years as it ought to responsibly have. If Hind rebelled, and Gandhāra’s position was seen as weak by the other Indian states, it was almost certain that the remaining states of the Punjab would pledge their support to Hind – or make a show of surrender to them.<br>“What is the cause of these events?” asked Ariyawratha “What is that factor that has undergone such change in the East, that it appears the Empire is left with no allies in the region?”<br>“Ally or no ally,” the Emperor growled, “We shall crush these rebellions and punish the traitors and all those who supported them, even if it bankrupts the treasury. I shall not be known as the Emperor who lost India.”<br>“It appears—,” started Haxamanish, “There are rumours— there are reliable reports, that the Eastern Empire … ” he controlled his stammering, “The Eastern Empire is expanding its boundaries once again. It appears that they are preparing for a Westward expedition soon – and is likely that they are sowing dissension in our Eastern provinces either with intent to conquer them, or to secure their independence from the Empire so they can be used as buffer states against us.”<br>Darayavaush let out a low growl. “So these rebels believe that the Easterners will come to their assistance?”<br>The messenger nodded. “The Easterners have set their sights on the city of Indraprastha – a site that is sacred to all Indians. If they conquer Indraprastha, they will truly be unstoppable, or so it is believed. But that is not all.”<br>“What could be worse than all that we have just heard?” Ariyawratha muttered dejectedly, but no one heard him. Even as he had only seen in all his life a Persia undefeated in battle, he was still possessed of sufficient age and sense to see the signs.<br>“The third piece of news,” Haxamanish stammered – his voice had become barely intelligible at this point, “O Great King of Kings … The rebellion is not only in the East – if rumour is correct … the king of the Greeks, Alexander, is planning an invasion of Persia. I fear to say this, Emperor – but such are the words used by your enemies in this very court: they say that the end times are near!— that the Frashokereti approaches!”<br>The messenger’s bloodied head rolled down the carpet.]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/specials/letters_speeches/magadha_persia_aftermath.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/specials/letters_speeches/magadha_persia_aftermath.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 19:21:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[pabbata_father]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>WAR UPDATE.<br>(Present to hear: Cāṇakya, Candragupta, Pāṇini, Apratimaujas, Daṇḍaśarman, Śrībhānu, the walls of the University of Takṣaśilā)<br>In the Eastern theatre, in Magadha—<br>As you know, Pabbata has by now lived among the people for seven years, gaining popularity among them and influencing their sentiment to be sympathetic to me and to the Vedic culture. Now with the assassination of his father, and conspiracy theories blaming Augraseniya or Sakadala as the culprit – or even that they are both in cahoots and only pretending to war, Pabbata has started to campaign in the countryside, and has already captured numerous forts.<br>I have been informed by one of my spies that some of the Magadhas, associating all three parties to the Civil War with the Brāhmaṇas whom they still despise, have taken to a fourth leader: an army general named Kalmasanghri of Rajagriha, who claims all the events underway to be the conspiracy of the Brāhmaṇas. I have reason to believe, however, that there is no cause to fear him.<br>Between Sakadala and Augraseniya, the treasury and most of the bureaucracy are favourable to Sakadala, while the palace-keepers and judiciary are favourable to Augraseniya; parts of the military are favourable to either side, while the majority wishes to unite against Pabbata as a common enemy.<br>Augraseniya correctly sees the treasury’s support for Sakadala as a threat, and will surely have most of the treasury-keepers executed – but he will do so in secret, so that it does not become known that the treasury is unguarded. Expecting this, I have made a plan that I will describe to you in brief: apparently operating on behalf of Sakadala, one spy in the army will launch an attack on the palace, apparently threatening the treasury but in reality focusing to sabotage the dams, sluices, all other machines controlling the flow of water, and the bridges; frightened, Augraseniya will attempt to have the treasury’s wealth relocated quickly to Rajagriha, where support for him is more secure; but in doing so, they will have to cross the river; spies in the army will pursue them, causing them to be hasty to leave the city; they will then be ambushed by Pabbata at the river, who will seize from them what wealth he can and cast the rest into the water. We may expect a great amount of labour to be spent into salvaging this wealth from the river – but it will take a long time for any significant amount of wealth to be retrieved, by when we will have won the war.<br>In the Central theatre, in the Central Country—<br>As you know, there are three events of significance that have given us almost a free hand in operating our spying activities in the occupied Central Country.<br>One, the extensive troubles in Magadha, and my extraction of the majority of the vassal state armies into the West to fight the Greeks, have left the Central Country almost unguarded in a sense. Not so unguarded that Magadha would allow a military invasion of the country, but it will overlook, or lacks the capacity to identify and stop, destabilizing activities. The problem with the Magadhis’ tyrannical approach to ruling is that simply executing the ruling noble families does not replace the underlying state infrastructure, which remains at least subconsciously sympathetic to the cause of overthrowing Magadhi rule. Thus we have, by inducing popular gossip, ignited new topics of discussion among the people: reminiscing about the past, instilling self-pride, tales of being saved by a messiah or hero, and need for unity against invaders such as the Greeks and other barbarians. I have, through such debates, pushed our people to be respected in society. This, along with the fact that much of their armies are currently under Candragupta’s command, will surely aid in inciting the states of the Central Country to betray Magadha at the time we will need them to.<br>Two, my provocation of Magadha into starting a trade war with the Ayudhajivi states has effectively closed Magadha off not only to trade, but also to information. Already due to their troubles, they are neglecting the importance of conveying as much information as is necessary to even maintain an empire; with the natural movement of traders stopped, we are able to keep track of who traverses the Northern Highway, and what information Magadha receives about the war in the Western theatre. This will also be of crucial importance to us later when we attack Magadha – for it will enable us to send falsified information about the war to each vassal, telling them that the remaining vassals have surrendered, or that Magadha has fallen, and so on.<br>Three, acquiring the Seal of the Peacock has given me magical powers. Or so at least I am able to convince many into believing. I am running a large financial scam – or rather, what would be a financial scam if we do not win this war, and end up unable to pay back these loans – where I simply promise each investor double his investment, and pay him off with the next investor’s money. Some believe this is possible for me because the Seal of the Peacock has granted me a great knowledge of alchemy, for Mathura has always been a centre for the study of alchemy; other believe it because I have successfully paid back some of the first investors; and a few see that it is a scam but think they can profit off it anyway, or correctly expect us to win the war and pay them back with tax money.<br>In the Western theatre, in Punjab—<br>Having sent away the armies of the Mallas and Kāśī, which are much more loyal to the Magadhi leadership, to the Greeks as part of the exchange agreement, the armies of the remaining vassals can almost be said to be ours. They are aware of the Civil War in Magadha and wish to play no part of it, instead choosing to place their faith in Candragupta’s leadership. They will stay under our command, as long as we can find a suitable excuse to keep them.<br>Possessing command of such a mighty army and having been the ones to retake their territory from the Greeks, our rule over Punjab, Sindh and the mountainous regions are uncontested by the local rulers. To make sure that they stay loyal, do not attempt to collaborate with our enemies, and do not interfere with our plans, I am instituting spies and other instruments to project our imperial sovereignty in these countries. There is no doubt that any of them could send messages to Magadha about our deceit – but due to our control over the Northern Highway, we can also send conflicting messages, and because Magadha is currently polarized in a Civil War, the choice of which messages to believe will start to organize themselves randomly by party lines, with or without our spies there actively fanning the flame.<br>Make no mistake of it: if I wished to destroy the Magadhi empire today, I could do it – that is how unstable it is. But doing so would not grant me the power I seek – and it is not desirable to let others gain power, for it is completely unpredictable what they may do with it. Thus all our endeavours from this point forward are in the interest of ensuring the stability of our future empire.]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/specials/letters_speeches/war_update.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/specials/letters_speeches/war_update.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2024 17:13:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[abandon_king]]></title><description><![CDATA[

My teacher holds that that officer who spends too much and brings in little revenue eats it up; while he who brings in more than he spends, as well as the officer who brings in as much as he spends does not eat up the revenue. But Kautilya holds that cases of embezzlement or no embezzlement can be ascertained through spies alone.
Whoever lessens the revenue eats the king's wealth. If owing to inadvertence he causes diminution in revenue, he shall be compelled to make good the loss; he shall be punished in proportion to the value of the work done, the number of days taken, the amount of capital spent, and the amount of daily wages paid.
Whoever doubles the revenue eats into the vitality of the country. If he brings in double the amount to the king, he shall, if the offence is small, be warned not to repeat the same; but if the offence be grave he should proportionally be punished.
Hence the chief officer of each department shall thoroughly scrutinise the real amount of the work done, the receipts realised from, and the expenditure incurred in that departmental work both in detail and in the aggregate.

Whoever attacks the kingdom may be put to death under the plea of disturbance and annoyance to the people; or having secretly punished the chief rebels of the royal family and brought them under his control, the minister shall himself take possession of the kingdom, for on account of the kingdom the father hates his sons, and sons their father; why then should the minister who is the sole prop of the kingdom (be an exception to it)? There-fore he shall never discard what has, of its own accord, fallen into his hands; for it is a general talk among the people that a woman making love of her own accord will, when discarded, curse the man. * "An opportunity will only once offer itself to a man who is waiting for it, and will not come a second time when he may be desirous of accomplishing his work."
"But it is," says Kautilya, "unrighteous to do an act which excites popular fury; nor is it an accepted rule. He shall, therefore, install in the kingdom such a son of the king as is possessed of amiable qualities. In the absence of a prince of good character, he may place before himself a wicked prince, or a princess, or the pregnant queen, and tell the other ministers:--„This is your caste (kshepa); look to the father of this (boy) as well as to your own valour and descent; this (boy) is merely a flag; and yourselves are the lords; pray, how shall I act‟?"
As he is saying this, others, taken in confidence before, shall say in reply:--"Who else than the one of your lead is capable of protecting the mass of the people of the four castes of the king" ? Then the other ministers will certainly agree to it.

When, after having put down the enemy, and after having grown in power, a friend becomes unsubmissive, the conqueror should cause the friend to incur the displeasure of a neighbour and of the king who is next to the neighbour.
Or the conqueror may employ a scion of the friend's family or an imprisoned prince to seize his lands; or the conqueror may so act that his friend, desirous of further help, may continue to be obedient.
The conqueror should never help his friend when the latter is deteriorating worse and worse; a politician should so keep his friend that the latter neither deteriorates nor grows in power.

But for the education I have given you, your fee will not be monetary.” “Name your price, Professor.” Kautilya turned to face his student and dearest friend. “Entire India.”<br>
(0.2)<br><br>“I am asking you to defeat not one, but two great empires: the Magadhas and the Greeks, each the largest to have existed in their respective realms, neither of which have lost two thirds of an inch of territory in the entire history of their existence.”<br>
(1.1)<br><br>“To keep a value more sacred than the truth is to dishonour the Goddess Sarasvati; to cut off a man's tongue is to point a sword at her throat.”<br>
(1.8)<br><br>“It was as if, in response to the relentless oppression against men’s lives and economy by wicked emperors, a voice had sounded from the heavens, and its words were: Neti Kautilyaḥ!”<br>
(1.10)<br><br>“The hand dexterous in grasping the halfa grass, fuel and stones, ladle, melted butter and the oblation vessel, unsheathed a flaming sword, eager to conquer the earth.”<br>
(2)<br><br>“Archers are fielded against infantry, cavalry against foot archers, and spies against conspirers.”<br>
(2.4)<br><br>“It is a natural tendency to view the world as governed by large things controlling small ones: large kingdoms dominating small ones, major cities ruling over satellite forts, men atop elephants and chariots directing regular cavalry and infantry. Yet machines may be designed so that a light touch to a thin string causes an entire palace to collapse.”<br>
(2.5)<br><br>“Let it be known, for centuries forth: that Magadha, after her conquest of Mathura, found herself conquered by her.”<br>

This explains the destruction of enemies and wild tribes:

<br>When an enemy in the rear and in the front, and an assailable enemy to be marched against happen together then the conqueror should adopt the following policy:
<br>The rear-enemy will usually lead the conqueror's frontal enemy to attack the conqueror's friend; then having set the enemy of the rear-enemy against the rear-enemy's ally
<br>and, having caused war between them, the conqueror should frustrate the rear-enemy's designs; likewise he should provoke hostilities between, the allies of the enemy of the rear-enemy and of the rear-enemy;
<br>he should also keep his frontal enemy's friend engaged in war with his own friend
<br>and with the help of his friend's friend, he should avert the attack, threatened by the friend of his enemy's friend;
<br>he should, with his friend's help, hold his rear-enemy at bay; and with the help of his friend's friend, he should prevent his rear-enemy attacking the enemy of the rear-enemy
<br>thus the conqueror should, through the aid of his friends, bring the Circle of States under his own sway both in his rear and front;
<br>he should send messengers and spies to reside in each of the states composing the Circle and having again and again destroyed the strength of his enemies he should keep his counsels concealed, being friendly with his friends;
<br>the works of him whose counsels are not kept concealed, will, though they may prosper for a time, perish as undoubtedly as a broken raft on the sea.

Astrologers, sooth-sayers, horologists, story-tellers and sign-readers, together with spies and their disciples, inclusive of those who have witnessed the wonderful performances of the conqueror should give wide publicity to the power of the king to associate with gods throughout his territory. Likewise in foreign countries, they should spread the news of gods appearing before the conqueror and of his having received from heaven weapons and treasure. Those who are well versed in horary and astrology and the science of omens should proclaim abroad that the conqueror is a successful expert in explaining the indications of dreams and in understanding the language of beasts and birds.

 <br><br>
In virtue of his power to uphold the observance of the respective duties of the four castes and of the four divisions of righteous life, and in virtue of his power to guard against the violation of Dharma, the king is the fountain of justice.
Sacred law, evidence, history, and government edicts are the four legs of Law. Of these four in order, the later supersedes the previously named.
Sacred law is eternal truth holding its sway over the world; evidence is in witnesses; history is what is found in the tradition of the people; government edicts are the orders pronounced by kings.
As the duty of a king consists in protecting his subjects with justice, its observance leads him to heaven. He who does not protect his people or upsets the social order wields his sceptre in vain. It is the sceptre and the sceptre alone which, only when exercised by the king with impartiality and in proportion to guilt either over his son or his enemy, maintains both this world and the next.
The king who administers justice in accordance with sacred law, evidence, history and edicts of kings which is the fourth will be able to conquer the whole world bounded by the four quarters.
Whenever there is disagreement between history and sacred law or between evidence and sacred law, then the matter shall be settled in accordance with sacred law. But whenever sacred law is conflict with rational law, then reason shall be held authoritative; for there the original text (on which the sacred law has been based) is not available.
Self-assertion on the part of either of the parties has often been found faulty. Examination, honesty, evidence and asseveration by oath – these alone can enable a man to win his cause.
Whenever by means of the deposition of witnesses, the statements of either of the parties are found contradictory, and whenever the cause of either of the parties is found by government spies to be false, then the decree shall be passed against that party

Marriage precedes the other calls of life. 

<br>The giving in marriage of a maiden well-adorned is called Brahma marriage.
<br>The joint-performance of sacred duties by a man and a woman is known as Prājāpatya marriage.
<br>The giving in marriage of a maiden for a couple of cows is called Arśa marriage.
<br>The giving in marriage of a maiden to an officiating priest in a sacrifice is called Daiva marriage.
<br>The voluntary union of a maiden with her lover is called Gandharva marriage.
<br>Giving a maiden after receiving plenty of wealth is termed Asura marriage.
<br>The abduction of a maiden is called Rākṣasa marriage.
<br>The abduction of a maiden while she is asleep and in intoxication is called Paiśāca marraige.

Of these, the first four are ancestral customs of old and are valid on their being approved of by the father.
The rest (Arśa, Asura) are to be sanctioned by both the father and the mother, for:

<br>It is they that receive the price paid by the bridegroom for their daughter.
<br>In case of the absence by death of either the father or the mother, the survivor will receive the price.
<br>If both of them are dead, the maiden herself shall receive it.

Any kind of marriage is approvable if it pleases all those who are concerned in it.

Whoever possesses enough experience of the world and its affairs may, through the influence of an interested friend, seek the favour of a king who is endowed with amiable qualities and is possessed of all the elements of sovereignty. He may court the favour of any king provided he thinks: Just as I am in need of a patron, so is this king possessed of a taste for good advice and is of amiable character. He may even court the favour of such a king as is poor and destitute of the elements of sovereignty, but never, of such a one as is of a depraved character: whoever, as a king, is destitute of good temper and amiable character cannot, by reason of his habitual hatred of the science of polity and an inborn proclivity to evil ways, maintain his sovereignty, though he is possessed of immense sovereign power.
Having obtained admittance to an amiable king, he shall give the king instructions in sciences. Absence of contradiction from the king will render his position secure. When his opinion is sought about present or future schemes needing much thought and consideration, he may boldly and sensibly, and with no fear of contradiction from the assembly of ministers, pronounce his opinion so as to be in harmony with the principles of righteousness and economy. When required, he may answer questions on points of righteousness and economy.

Proclamation of his omniscience is as follows: rejection of his chief officers when their secret domestic and other private affairs are known; revealing the names of traitors after receiving information from spies specially employed to find out such men; pointing out the impolitic aspect of any course of action suggested to him; and pretensions to the knowledge of foreign affairs by means of his power to read omens and signs invisible to others when information about foreign affairs is just received through a domestic pigeon which has brought a sealed letter.

When in the interior of the harem, the king shall see the queen only when her personal purity is vouchsafed by an old maid-servant. He shall not touch any woman (unless he is apprised of her personal purity); for hidden in the queen's chamber, his own brother slew king Bhadrasena; hiding himself under the bed of his mother, the son killed king Kárusa; mixing fried rice with poison, as though with honey, his own queen poisoned Kásirája; with an anklet painted with poison, his own queen killed Vairantya; with a gem of her zone bedaubed with poison, his own queen killed Sauvíra; with a looking glass painted with poison, his own queen killed Jálútha; and with a weapon hidden under her tuft of hair, his own queen slew Vidúratha. Hence the king shall always be careful to avoid such lurking dangers. He shall keep away his wives from the society of ascetics with shaved head or braided hair, of buffoons, and of outside servant girls. Nor shall women of high birth have occasion to see his wives except appointed midwives.

In a well-guarded locality, the head-cook shall supervise the preparation of varieties of relishing dishes. The king shall partake of such fresh dishes after making an oblation out of them first to the fire and then to birds.
When the flame and the smoke turn blue and crackle, and when birds (that eat the oblation) die, presence of poison (in the dish) shall be inferred. When the vapour arising from cooked rice possesses the colour of the neck of a peacock, and appears chill as if suddenly cooled, when vegetables possess an unnatural colour, and are watery and hardened, and appear to have suddenly turned dry, being possessed of broken layers of blackish foam, and being devoid of smell, touch and taste natural to them; when utensils reflect light either more or less than usual, and are covered with a layer of foam at their edges; when any liquid preparation possesses streaks on its surface; when milk bears a bluish streak in the centre of its surface; when liquor and water possess reddish streaks; when curd is marked with black and dark streaks, and honey with white streaks; when watery things appear parched as if overcooked and look blue and swollen; when dry things have shrank and changed in their colour; when hard things appear soft, and soft things hard; when minute animalculae die in the vicinity of the dishes; when carpets and curtains possess blackish circular spots, with their threads and hair fallen off; when metallic vessels set with gems appear tarnished as though by roasting, and have lost their polish, colour, shine, and softness of touch, presence of poison shall be inferred.
As to the person who has administered poison, the marks are parched and dry mouth; hesitation in speaking; heavy perspiration; yawning; too much bodily tremor; frequent tumbling; evasion of speech; carelessness in work; and unwillingness to keep to the place assigned to him.
Hence physicians and experts capable of detecting poison shall ever attend upon the king.
Having taken out from the store-room of medicines that medicine the purity of which has been proved by experiment, and having himself together with the decoctioner and the purveyor tasted it, the physician shall hand over the medicine to the king. The same rule shall apply to liquor and other beverages.

When a king of poor resources is attacked by a powerful enemy, he should surrender himself together with his sons to the enemy and live like a reed (in the midst of a current of water).
Bhāradvāja says that he who surrenders himself to the strong, bows down before Indra (the god of rain).
But Viśālākṣa says that a weak king should rather fight with all his resources, for bravery destroys all troubles; fighting is the natural duty of a kṣatriya, no matter whether he achieves victory or sustains defeat in battle.
No, says Kauṭilya: he who bows down to all like a crab on the riverbank lives in despair; whoever goes with his small army to fight perishes like a man attempting to cross the sea without a boat. Hence, a weak king should either seek the protection of a powerful king or maintain himself in an impregnable fort.

Removal of vices and troubles, recruitment (of new men), keeping away from places of an enemy's ambush, and harmony among the officers of the army, are the means of protecting the army from troubles.

High birth, godliness, heroism, seeing through the eyes of elders, virtue, truthfulness, non-contradiction, gratefulness, high goals, enthusiasm, non-procrastination, power, resolute mind, an assembly of viceless ministers, a taste for discipline; these are the qualities of an inviting nature.
Inquiry, hearing, perception, retention in memory, reflection, deliberation, inference and steadfast adherence to conclusions are the qualities of the intellect.
Valour, determination of purpose, quickness, and probity are the aspects of enthusiasm.
Sharp intellect, strong memory, keen mind, energy, power, training in all the arts, vicelessness, justice, dignity, preparedness, foresight, readiness to avail himself of afforded opportunities in respect of place, time, and manly efforts, cleverness to discern the cause for peace treaty or war, capacity to make jokes without loss of dignity or secrecy, never brow-beating and casting haughty and stern looks, freedom from passion, anger, greed, obstinacy, fickleness, haste and back-biting habits, a smiling demeanour, observance of elders’ customs; such is the nature of self-possession.

 <br>Empires that were too big to fall – he toppled them.<br>Sciences that were too vast to comprehend – he fathered them.<br>A continent that was too great to rule – he conquered it.<br><br>“The concept of atoning for one’s sins is the fallacy of Magadhi philosophy,” Cāṇakya had replied, “The goal of life is not to merely ensure that one does more good than bad, it is not to merely justify your existence in the world. The goal of life is to do as much good as possible, and that rarely comes from men who justify their actions on basis of doing good. Therein lies the distinction, between goodness and greatness.”<br><br>Speaking to the fertile lands of Magadha, to the rivers that irrigated it, to its human settlements, Cāṇakya spoke.<br>I claim you as mine, he said – in the epic historical battle between the light of the Vedas and the wickedness that originated in this realm, the final move shall be mine.<br>And simply defending one’s holdings, or re-taking lost territories, would hardly be such a final move.<br>I will return, wielding in battle that torch that Vasiṣṭha had borne so many years ago taking the Bhāratas to their victory against the Purus – I shall take that throne you forbade me from resting on, and give it in charity to the deserving.<br>I swear to adopt the art of cunning; to be restrained by no foolish idealisms; to employ any means necessary to accomplish these goals.<br>Let it be known for centuries forth: that Magadha, after conquering Mathura, found herself conquered by her.<br><br>“Perhaps we ought to spend some time and think about alternative approaches in more detail,” Cāṇakya suggested. “And if we find one, we could send another scholar, trained to that approach, with an apology for my behaviour—”<br>Professor Caṇin interrupted him with a wry yet sympathetic smile.<br>“Viṣṇugupta,” he said gently, “What good is a life of apology?”<br><br>“Too many aged men emphasize sattva alone, but sattva without rajas is like an archer without his bow. Such a man, even as he goes to great lengths to do good rather than bad, never accomplishes any significant amount of good, for he is lacking in ambition. Certainly, the quality of sattva is to be honoured, as we honour cows – for the cow symbolizes sattva, as the vulture symbolizes tamas, yet neither of them is capable of ruling the world. No, it is man, and man alone, who possesses rajas, who is equipped to rule the world.<br>“Too many young men emphasize rajas alone: princes who spend their lives rallying armies to battle, never quite identifying what it is they are fighting for. Such men’s names are never immortalized in history, for in all their lives they accomplish nothing but the change of the colour of a flag on a fort, or some letters on a writ. For rajas alone, without sattva or tamas, is ambitiousness without ambition, it is passion without purpose. Such ones are mere tools to those men who possess true ambition.<br><br>“How blissful it is,” he said, “To be young and believe one knows everything. I must relish the nostalgia. You have studied under the Professors at Takṣaśilā, Cāṇakya, and have believed their words to be truth – but I could name you tens of more experienced scholars at Sauvīrāyana and elsewhere, who have discussed at length the value of heroism over discipline, and the disaster that discipline has spelled for the kṣatriya race.”<br>Cāṇakya gave a wry smile in response, that alone sufficed to rescue the university from a historic humiliation, and to secure Takṣaśilā its twenty-first consecutive victory at the Yājñavalkya Debates.<br>“Tens of scholars?” he asked. “I only need two: myself, and the goddess Vāc, who smiles down upon me when I speak the truth.”<br><br>“I told Professor Ṛṣyaśṛṅga that I wished to study at Takṣaśilā,” he stated. “That I wished to be his student. The Professor declined, telling me the knowledge-line on my palm was not deep enough. I did not know which line that was, so I carved all of them with a knife.”<br>Cāṇakya held the boy’s gaze for a full half-minute.<br>“That intelligence resides behind the forehead, not on the palm, is known to all men who possess any of it. What is your name, child?”<br>“Pāṇini,” said the boy.<br><br>She introduced herself, then said: “I had some objections to what you said at the debate, but didn’t wish to betray you and the university by interrupting you mid-speech.”<br>“Oh?” Cāṇakya started. “You should have. If you were to defeat me now, my win would be tainted.”<br>“I was unaware,” she said shamefully. “I’m new to Takṣaśilā, and am not familiar with what’s considered polite.”<br>Cāṇakya, for all his apparent haughtiness from afar, said something fairly decent for once: “Do whatever is right, and no one will be offended in Takṣaśilā. Honesty is what we regard as polite; dishonesty is the gravest insult.”<br><br>“It is only those born to wealth who do not understand its value, only those born with great intelligence who cannot comprehend what cognitive capacities they possess that others do not, and it is beautiful women who downplay the importance of being well-formed or shower dishonest praise on the beauty of their uglier friends. There is a great deal that wealth can buy, and wealth is an encapsulation of the deeds of a man – for a man earns wealth by giving goods to his clients, and loses wealth by taking goods from sellers. There are indeed goods that money cannot buy, but an honest man must find it upsetting that such goods cannot be bought by money, and think of methods to make such goods purchasable to money, rather than celebrate such goods for their inability to be purchased by money.”<br><br>“I’m sure that you, and the Greeks in general, also agree with the Indian opinion on the proper method to wash oneself after defecating—”<br>“—actually, we don’t agree on that—”<br>“—but it is through discussing disagreement, not agreement, that the progress of the world is achieved. Agreement is the consequence, not the cause, of a successful debate that dispels false beliefs on either or both sides.”<br><br>“History is littered with the corpses of forgotten men who were ahead of their time,”<br><br>Their way of life was dying.<br>The Brāhmaṇas were winning.<br>The light of the Vedas was burning through the country—<br>—for the Sun had risen in the West.]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/specials/quotes/arthashastra/quotable.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/specials/quotes/arthashastra/quotable.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2024 15:32:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[ravana_duryodhana]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Ravana, unwilling under the influence of vanity to restore a stranger's wife; Duryodhana, to part with a portion of his kingdom; Dambhodbhava and Arjuna of the Haihaya dynasty being so haughty as to despise all people; Vatapi in his attempt under the influence of overjoy to attack Agastya, as well as the Vṛṣṇi corporation in their attempt against Dvaipayana.
Thus these and other several kings, falling a prey to the aggregate of the six enemies and having failed to restrain their organs of sense, perished together with their kingdom and relations. Having driven out the aggregate of the six enemies, Ambarisha of the Jamadagnya dynasty, famous for his restraint over the senses long enjoyed the earth, as did Nabhaga.

Hence by overthrowing the aggregate of the six vices, [a saintly king] shall restrain the organs of sense; acquire wisdom by keeping company with the aged; see through his spies; establish safety and security by being ever active; maintain his subjects in the observance of their respective duties by exercising authority; keep up his personal discipline by receiving lessons in the sciences; and endear himself to the people by bringing them in contact with wealth and doing good to them.
Thus with his organs of sense under his control, he shall keep away from hurting the women and property of others; avoid not only lustfulness, even in dream, but also falsehood, haughtiness, and evil proclivities; and keep away from unrighteous and uneconomical transactions.
Not violating righteousness and economy, he shall enjoy his desires. He shall never be devoid of happiness. He may enjoy in an equal degree the three pursuits of life: righteousness, wealth, and desire, which are inter-dependent upon each other. Any one of these three, when enjoyed to an excess, hurts not only the other two, but also itself.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 1.7:1-5

The king may in great emergencies demand one-third or one-fourth in taxes from the inhabitants of fertile country, but not of those who inhabit tracts of middle or low quality or forest tribes, nor people employed in the construction of infrastructure or the colonisation of wastelands, nor of learned Brāhmaṇas – these properties he may only purchase at a favourable compensation.
(…) Such demands will never be done repeatedly. In lieu of such demands, the collector general shall seek subscriptions from citizens and country people alike under false pretences of carrying some kind of business. Persons taken in concert shall publicly pay handsome donations and with this example, the king may demand of others among his subjects. Spies posing as citizens shall revile those who pay less. Wealthy persons may be requested to give as much of their gold as they can. Those who, of their own accord or with the intention of doing good, offer their wealth to the king shall be honoured with a rank in the court, an umbrella, or a turban or some ornaments in return for their gold.
(…) Or spies may call upon spectators to see a serpent with innumerable heads in a well connected with a subterranean passage and collect fees from them for the sight. Or they may place in a borehole made in the body of an image of a serpent, or in a hole in the corner of a temple, or in the hollow of an ant-hill, a cobra, which is, by diet, rendered unconscious, and call upon credulous spectators to see it (on payment of a certain amount of fee). As to persons who are not by nature credulous, spies may sprinkle over or give a drink of, such sacred water as is mixed with anasthetic ingredients and attribute their insensibility to the curse of gods. Or by causing an outcast person to be bitten by a cobra, spies may collect revenue under the pretext of undertaking remedial measures against ominous phenomena.
—Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 5.2

Painters, carpenters, heretics, actors, merchants, and other disguised spies belonging to the conqueror’s army may also reside inside the fort of the enemy. Spies, disguised as agriculturists, may supply them with weapons taken in carts loaded with firewood, grass, grains, and other commodities of commerce, or disguised as images and flags of gods. Then spies, disguised as priests, may announce to the enemy, blowing their conch-shells and beating their drums, that a besieging army, eager to destroy all, and armed with weapons, is coming closely behind them. Then in the ensuing tumult, they may surrender the fort gate and the towers of the fort to the army of the conqueror or disperse the enemy’s army and bring about his fall.
Or taking advantage of peace and friendship with the enemy, army and weapons may be collected inside the enemy’s fort by spies disguised as merchants, caravans, processions leading a bride, merchants selling horses, pedlars trading in miscellaneous articles, purchasers or sellers of grains, and as ascetics. These and others are the spies aiming at the life of a king.

Hence [the prince] shall be taught only of righteousness and of wealth, but not of unrighteousness and of non-wealth. Classmate spies shall be so courteous towards him as to say “thine are we.”
When under the temptation of youth, he turns his eye towards women, impure women under the disguise of Āryas shall, at night and in lonely places, terrify him; when fond of liquor, he shall be terrified by making him drink drugged liquor; when fond of gambling, he shall be terrified by spies under the disguise of fraudulent persons; when fond of hunting, he shall be terrified by spies under the disguise of highway robbers; and when desirous of attacking his own father, he shall, under the pretence of compliance, be gradually persuaded of the evil consequences of such attempts, by telling: a king is not made by a mere wish; failure of thy attempt will bring about thy own death; success makes thee fall into hell and causes the people to lament for thy father and destroy the only clod, i.e. thyself.

The conqueror may dismiss a confidential chief of a corporation. The chief may go over to the enemy as a friend and offer to supply him with recruits and other help collected from the conqueror's territory or followed by a band of spies — and please the enemy by destroying a disloyal village or a regiment or an ally of the conqueror — and by sending as a present the elephants, horses, and disaffected persons of the conqueror's army or of the latter's ally (…)
And when he has gained their confidence, he may send them down to the conqueror to be routed down on the occasion of a farcical attempt to capture elephants or wild tribes.

A spy, under the guise of an astrologer, may describe to a chief the destiny of a maiden who is at the point of being married to another, and say: “This man’s daughter deserves to be the wife of a king, and will bring forth a son destined to be a king; purchase her with all your wealth, or seize her by force.” When it is not possible to secure her, spies should enrage the parties; but when she is secured quarrel will necessarily ensue.
A mendicant woman may tell a chief who is fond of his wife: “This (another) chief, proud of his youth, has sent me to entice your wife; being afraid of him, I have taken with me his letter and jewellery (for your wife); your wife is free from sin; secret steps should be taken against him; and I am very anxious (about your success).”
Thus in these and other kinds of brawls which have originated of themselves or which have been brought about by spies, the conqueror should help the inferior party with men and money and set them against the wicked or cause them to migrate (to other parts of the country).

When the enemy is desirous of taking possession of the territory of the conqueror’s friend, then the conqueror may, under the pretence of compliance, supply the enemy with army. Then, having entered into a secret concert with the friend, the conqueror may pretend to be under troubles and allow himself to be attacked by the enemy combined with the neglected friend. Then, hemmed from two sides, the enemy may be killed or captured alive to distribute his territory among the conqueror and his friend.

Or he may pretend to be in communion with the god Varuna in a reservoir through a tunnel at night while spies under the guise of grocers may poison the sentinels – or fire may be set to stores of commercial articles. In view of avoiding the fear of pursuit, he may place a human body in the house he occupied, set fire to it and escape by breaking open some house-joints or a window, or through a tunnel – or disguise himself as a transporter of commodities like glass beads or pots – or as an ascetic after entering the residence of one – or as a forest recluse – or as someone suffering from a peculiar disease – or as a corpse – or as a widowed wife, following a corpse being carried away – or in the midst of carts and cart-drivers – and spies disguised as forest-people should misguide pursuers by pointing in an incorrect direction.
If he is closely followed, he may lead the pursuers to an ambush, or in the absence of an ambush leave gold or morsels of poisoned food by the sides of the road and take a different road. If he is captured, he should try to win over the pursuers by conciliation and other means, or poison them, or fight them with a concealed sword and the help of sentinels and previously-concealed spies. Or the king may accuse the enemy of the prince’s murder and attack them.

Spies, disguised as hunters, may take a stand near the gate of the enemy’s fort to sell flesh, and make friendship with the sentinels at the gate. Having informed the enemy of the arrival of thieves on two or three occasions, they may prove themselves to be of reliable character and cause him to split his army into two divisions and to station them in two different parts of his territory. When his villages are being plundered or besieged, they may tell him that thieves are come very near, that the tumult is very great, and that a large army is required.
They may take the army supplied, and surrendering it to the commander laying waste the villages, return at night with a part of the commander’s army, and cry aloud at the gate of the fort that the thieves are slain, that the army has returned victorious, and that the gate may be opened. When the gate is opened by the watchmen under the enemy’s order or by others in confidence, they may strike the enemy with the help of the army.

After making peace with the enemy, the conqueror may dismiss his own confidential ministers. They may request the enemy to reconcile them to their master. When the enemy sends a messenger for this purpose, the conqueror may rebuke him and say: “Thy master attempts to sow the seeds of dissension between myself and my ministers; so thou should not come here again.” Then one of the dismissed ministers may go over to the enemy, taking with him a band of spies, disaffected people, traitors, brave thieves, and wild tribes who make no distinction between a friend and a foe. Having secured the good graces of the enemy, the minister may propose to him the destruction of his officers, such as the boundary-guard, wild chief, and commander of his army, telling him: “These and other persons are in concert with your enemy.” Then these persons may be put to death under the unequivocal orders of the enemy.

A merchant spy may pretend to be in love with a maidservant of the queen, then abandon her. Another spy may then give that maidservant a drug, claiming it to be a love potion to regain her lover.
On her attaining success, that maidservant may inform the queen that the same drug may be applied to the king to secure his love. The drug will then be swapped for poison, and the king murdered.

 <br><br>
Reduction (of the enemy) must precede a siege.
Having well guarded his camp, transports, supplies and also the roads of communication, and having dug up a ditch and raised a rampart round his camp, he may vitiate the water in the ditches round the enemy’s fort, or empty the ditches of their water, or fill them with water if empty, and then he may assail the rampart and the parapets by making use of underground tunnels and iron rods. If the ditch is very deep, he may fill it up with soil. If it is defended by a number of men, he may destroy it by means of machines. Horse soldiers may force their passage through the gate into the fort and smite the enemy. Now and then, in the midst of tumult, he may offer terms to the enemy by taking recourse to one, two, three, or all of the strategic means.
Having captured the birds, such as the vulture, crow, naptr, beared vulture, parrot, mynah, and pigeon, which have their nests in the fort walls, and having tied to their tails inflammable powder, he may let them fly to the forts. If the camp is situated at a distance from the fort and is provided with an elevated post for archers and their flags, then the enemy’s fort may be set on Are. Spies, living as watchmen of the fort, may tie inflammable powder to the tails of mongooses, monkeys, cats and dogs, and let them go over the thatched roofs of the houses. A splinter of fire kept in the body of a dried fish may be caused to be carried off by a monkey, or a crow, or any other bird (to the thatched roofs of the houses).
When the conqueror thinks: “I am well provided with all necessary means and with workmen, whereas my enemy is diseased, with officers proved to be impure under temptations, with unfinished forts and deficient stores, allied with no friends, or with friends inimical at heart,” then he should consider it as an opportune moment to take up arms and storm the fort.
When fire, accidental or intentionally kindled, breaks out; when the enemy’s people are engaged in a sacrificial performance, or in witnessing spectacles or the troops, or in quarrel due to the drinking of liquor; or when the enemy’s army is too much tired by daily engagements in battles and is reduced in strength in consequence of the slaughter of a number of its men in a number of battles; when the enemy’s people wearied from sleeplessness have fallen asleep; or on the occasion of a cloudy day of floods, or of a thick fog or snow, general assault should be made.
Or having concealed himself in a forest after abandoning the camp, the conqueror may strike the enemy when the latter comes out.
Either a conquered enemy or the chief of a wild tribe (in conspiracy with the conqueror) may inform the besieged: “With the intention of escaping from a disease, or from the attack in his weak point by his enemy in the rear, or from a rebellion in his army, the conqueror seems to be thinking of going elsewhere, abandoning the siege.” When the enemy is made to believe this, the conqueror may set fire to his camp and retire. Then the enemy coming out may be hemmed... as before.
Or a pretending ally of the enemy may send a messenger to the enemy, asking him: “Come out to smite the conqueror already struck by me.” When he does so, he may be hemmed... as before.
Or a pretending ally of the enemy may send information to the besieged: “I am going to strike the besieging camp at such a time and place; then you should also fight along with me.” When the enemy does so, or when he comes out of his fort after witnessing the tumult and uproar of the besieging army in danger, he may be slain as before.
Or a friend or a wild chief in friendship with the enemy may be induced and encouraged to seize the land of the enemy when the latter is besieged by the conqueror. When accordingly any one of them attempts to seize the enemy’s territory, the enemy’s people or the leaders of the enemy’s traitors may be employed to murder him (the friend or the wild chief); or the conqueror himself may administer poison to him. Then another pretending friend may inform the enemy that the murdered person was a fratricide (as he attempted to seize the territory of his friend in troubles). After strengthening his intimacy with the enemy, the pretending friend may sow the seeds of dissension between the enemy and his officers and have the latter hanged. Causing the peaceful people of the enemy to rebel, he may put them down, unknown to the enemy. Then having taken with him a portion of his army composed of furious wild tribes, he may enter the enemy’s fort and allow it to be captured by the conqueror. Or traitors, enemies, wild tribes and other persons who have deserted the enemy, may, under the plea of having been reconciled, honoured and rewarded, go back to the enemy and allow the fort to be captured by the conqueror.
When a fort can be captured by other means, no attempt should be made to set fire to it; for fire cannot be trusted; it not only offends gods, but also destroys the people, grains, cattle, gold, raw materials and the like. Also the acquisition of a fort with its property all destroyed is a source of further loss.
A king, pretending to be the enemy’s chief friend or ally, may make the friendship closer with the besieged, and send a messenger to say: “This is thy weak point; these are thy internal enemies; that is the weak point of the besieger; and this person (who, deserting the conqueror, is now coming to thee) is thy partisan.” When this partisan is returning with another messenger from the enemy, the conqueror should catch hold of him, and having published the partisan’s guilt, should banish him, and retire from the siege operations. Then the pretending friend may tell the besieged: “Gome out to help me, or let us combine and strike the besieger.” Accordingly, when the enemy comes out, he may be hemmed between the two forces (the conqueror’s force and the pretending friend’s force) and killed or captured alive to distribute his territory (between the conqueror and the friend). His capital city may be razed to the ground; and the flower of his army be made to come out and be destroyed.
Having captured the fort or having returned to the camp after its capture, he should give quarter to those of the enemy’s army who, whether as lying prostrate in the field, or as standing with their back turned to the conqueror, or with their hair dishevelled, with their weapons thrown down or with their body disfigured and shivering under fear, surrender themselves. After the captured fort is cleared of the enemy’s partisans and is well guarded by the conqueror’s men, both within and without, he should make his victorious entry into it.
Having thus seized the territory of the enemy close to his country, the conqueror should direct his attention to that of the Madhyama king; this being taken, he should catch hold of that of the neutral king. This is the first way to conquer the world. In the absence of the Madhyama and neutral kings, he should, in virtue of his own excellent qualities, win the hearts of his enemy’s subjects, and then direct his attention to other remote enemies. This is the second way. In the absence of a Circle of States (to be conquered), he should conquer his friend or his enemy by hemming each between his own force and that of his enemy or that of his friend respectively. This is the third way. Or he may first put down an almost invincible immediate enemy. Having doubled his power by this victory, he may go against a second enemy: having trebled his power by this victory, he may attack a third. This is the fourth way to conquer the world. Having conquered the earth with its people of distinct castes and divisions of religious life, he should enjoy it by governing it in accordance with the duties prescribed to kings.

Having acquired a new territory, he should cover the enemy's vices with his own virtues, and the enemy's virtues by doubling his own virtues, by strict observance of his own duties, by attending to his works, by bestowing rewards, by remitting taxes, by giving gifts, and by bestowing honours.
He should follow the friends and leaders of the people.
He should give rewards, as promised, to those who deserted the enemy for his cause; he should also offer rewards to them as often as they render help to him; for whoever fails to fullfil his promises becomes untrustworthy both to his own and his enemy's people.
Whoever acts against the will of the people will also become unreliable. He should adopt the same mode of life, the same dress, language, and customs as those of the people. He should follow the people in their faith with which they celebrate their national, religious and congregational festivals or amusements.
His spies should often bring home to the mind of the leaders of provinces, villages, castes, and corporations the hurt inflicted on the enemies in contrast with the high esteem and favour with which they are treated by the conqueror, who finds his own prosperity in theirs. He should please them by giving gifts, remitting taxes, and providing for their security.
He should always hold righteous life in high esteem. Learned men, orators, charitable and brave persons should be favoured with gifts of land and money and with remission of taxes.
He should release all the prisoners, and afford help to miserable, helpless, and diseased persons. He should prohibit the slaughter of animals for half a month during the period of Cháturmásya (from July to September), for four nights during the full moon, and for a night on the day of the birth-star of the conqueror or of the national star.
He should also prohibit the slaughter of females and young ones (yonibálavadham) as well as castration. Having abolished those customs or transactions which he might consider either as injurious to the growth of his revenue and army or as unrighteous, he should establish righteous transactions.
He should exile born thieves, barbarians and traitors to remote areas, as with the captured enemy. Those who were opposed to him, but are convinced of their own fall with that of their master, should be pacified. If a relative of the enemy takes shelter in a wild tract on the border and harasses him, he should be provided with a sterile portion of territory or with one fourth of a fertile tract, on the condition of supplying the conqueror a fixed amount of money and troops, in raising which he will incur the displeasure of the people and be destroyed by them.
He should initiate the observance of all those customs, which, though righteous and practised by others, are not observed in his own country, and give no room for the practice of whatever is unrighteous, though observed by others.

Chapter summary: Army arrays – staff, snake, circle, detached order; counter-arrays
According to Brihaspati, an array is comprised of the front and reserve, two wings, and two flanks. The principal arrays – staff, snake, circle, detached order – are varieties of the above two forms consisting of wings, flanks and front.
Stationing the army so as to stand abreast, is called a Staff array.
Stationing the army in a line so that one may follow the other, is called a Snake array.
Stationing the army so as to face all the directions, is called a Circle array.
Detached arrangement of the army into small independent units is called a Detached Order array.
A Staff array has equal strength on its wings, flanks and front.
It is called a Breaking-the-enemy-array array when its flanks are made to project in front.
It is called a Firm array when its wings and flanks are stretched back.
It is called an Irresistible array when its wings are lengthened.
It is called an Eagle array when, having formed the wings, the front is made to bulge out.
The reverse-form arrangements of the four arrays above are respectively called a Bow, a Centre of a bow, a Hold, and a Stronghold array.
It is called a Victory array when the wings are arrayed like a bow.
It is called a Conqueror array when the front is projected.
It is called a Big Ear array when its flanks and wings are formed like a staff.
It is called a Vast Victory array when its front made twice as strong as a Conqueror array.
It is called an Army-Face array when it has its wings stretched forward.
The reverse-form arrangement of an Army-Face array is called a Fish-Face array.
It is called a Pin array when one constituent of the army is made to stand behind the other.
A Pin array comprised of two lines or four lines is known as an Aggregate or Invincible array respectively.
These are the varieties of the Staff array.
A Snake array has its wings and front capable of turning.
It is called a Serpentine or Cow-urine array when its wings, flank and front are of unequal depth.
It is called a Cart array when it consists of two lines in front and has its wings arranged as in the staff-like array.
The reverse-form arrangement of a Cart array is called a Crocodile array.
A Cart array consisting of elephants, horses and chariots is called a Swift World Conquest array.
These are the varieties of the Snake array.
A Circle array’s varieties are the All-auspicious, One-of-eight-divisions and Victory arrays.
A Detached order array has its wings, flanks and front stationed apart.
It is called a Diamond or Alligator array when five divisions of the army are arranged in detached order.
It is called a Park or Crow’s foot array when four divisions of the army are arranged in detached order.
It is called a Half-moon or Crab array when three divisions of the army are arranged in detached order.
These are the varieties of the array in detached order.
An array is called Auspicious if its chariots form the front, elephants the wings, and horses the rear.
An array is called Immovable If infantry, cavalry, chariots and elephants stand one behind the other.
An array is called Invincible if elephants, horses, chariots and infantry stand in order one behind the other.
Of these, the conqueror should assail the Breaking-the-enemy-array array with the Firm array, the Firm array with the Irresistible array, the Eagle array with the Bow array, the Hold Array with the Stronghold array, the Victory array with the Conqueror array, the Big Ear array with the Vast Victory array, the Swift World Conquest array with the All-auspicious array, and all kinds of arrays with the Invincible array.

Which is better of the two, a small mine of valuable yield, or a big mine productive of commodities of inferior value? My teacher says that the former is better inasmuch as valuable products, such as diamonds, precious stones, pearls, corals, gold and silver, can swallow vast quantities of inferior commodities.
Not so, says Kautilya, for there is the possibility of purchasing valuable commodities by a mass of accumulated articles of inferior value, collected from a vast and longstanding mine of inferior commodities.

Which is better, a friend of vast population, or a friend of immense gold? My teacher says that a friend of vast population is better inasmuch as such a friend will be of imposing power and can, when he rises up, accomplish any work undertaken.

Moreover armies and other desired objects can be purchased for gold.

Which is better, a friend possessing gold, or a friend possessing vast territory? My teacher says that a friend possessing gold can stand any heavy expenditure made with discretion.

Which is better, scattered troops, or an unsubmissive standing army? My teacher says that scattered troops can be collected in time as they are of submissive nature.

Which is better of the two: a friend of long-standing, but unsubmissive nature, or a temporary friend of submissive nature, both being acquired by affording relief from their respective troubles? My teacher says that a long-standing friend of unsubmissive nature is better inasmuch as such a friend, though not helpful, will not create harm.
Not so, says Kautilya: a temporary friend of submissive nature is better; for such a friend will be a true friend so long as he is helpful; for the real characteristic of friendship lies in giving help.

Their horsemen have two javelins, like lances, and a small shield smaller than the infantry’s shields. The horses have no saddles, nor do they use Greek bits nor any like the Celtic bits. Instead, around the end of the horses’ mouths they have an untanned stitched rein fitted with fitted bronze or iron spikes (but somewhat blunted) on the inside. The rich people have ivory spikes. Within the mouth of the horses is a bit, like a spit, with reins attached at both ends. Then, when they tighten the reins, this bit controls the horse and the spikes attached to it prick the horse and force it to follow the rein.
—Megasthenes, according to Arrian’s Indica, 8.16

Of the great officers of state, some have charge of the market, others of the city, others of the soldiers. Some superintend the rivers, measure the land, as is done in Egypt, and inspect the sluices by which water is let out from the main canals into their branches, so that everyone may have an equal supply of it.
The same persons have charge also of the huntsmen, and are entrusted with the power of rewarding or punishing them according to their deserts. They collect the taxes, and superintend the occupations connected with land, as those of the woodcutters, the carpenters, the blacksmiths, and the miners. They construct roads, and at every ten stadia set up a pillar to show the by-roads and distances.

Next to the city magistrates there is a third governing body, which directs military affairs. This also consists of six divisions, with five members to each.
One division is appointed to cooperate with the admiral of the fleet, another with the superintendent of the bullock-trains which are used for transporting engines of war, food for the soldiers, provender for the cattle, and other military requisites. They supply servants who beat the drum, and others who carry gongs; grooms also for the horses, and mechanists and their assistants.
The third division has charge of the foot-soldiers, the fourth of the horses, the fifth of the war-chariots, and the sixth of the elephants.
There are royal stables for the horses and elephants, and also a royal magazine for the arms, because the soldier has to return his arms to the magazine, and his horse and his elephant to the stables.

 <br><br>Strab. XV. I. G-S,—pp. 636-033.<br>That the Indians had never been attacked by others, nor had themselves attacked others. But what just reliance can we place on the accounts of India from such expeditions as those of Kyros and Semiramis?<br>Megasthenēs concurs in this view, and recommends his readers to put no faith in the ancient history of India. Its people, he says, never, sent an expedition abroad, nor was their country ever invaded and conquered except by Hērakles and Dionysos in old times, and by the Makedonians in our own.<br>Yet Sesōstris the Egyptian and Tearkōn the Ethiopian advanced as far as Europe. And Nabukodrosorc who is more renowned among the Chaldaeans than even Hērakles among the Greeks, carried his arms to the Pillars, which Tearkōn also reached, while Sesōstris penetrated from Iberia even into Thrace and Pontos. Besides these there was Idanthyrsos the Scythian, who overran Asia as far as Egypt. But not one of these great conquerors approached India, and Semiramis, who meditated its conquest, died before the necessary preparations were undertaken. <br>The Persians indeed summoned the Hydrakaif from India to serve as mercenaries, but they did not lead an army into the country, and only approached its borders when Kyros marched against the Massagetai.<br>The expedition of Semiramis as described by Diodorus Siculus (II. 16-19), who followed the Assyriaka of Ktēsias, has almost the character of a legend abounding with puerilities, and is entirely destitute of those geographical details which stamp events with reality. If this expedition is real, as on other grounds we may believe it to be, some traces will assuredly be found of it in the cuneiform inscriptions of Nineveh, which are destined to throw so much unexpected light on the ancient history of Asia.<br>It has already been believed possible to draw from these inscriptions the foundations of a positive chronology which will fully confirm the indications given by Herodotus as the real historical character of the expeditions of Semiramis and Kyros, it is certain that their conquests on the Indus were only temporary acquisitions, since at the epoch when Dareios Hystaspēs mounted the throne the eastern frontier of the empire did not go beyond Arakhosia (the Haraqaiti of the Zend texts, the Haraouvatis of the cuneiform inscriptions, the Arrokhadj of Musalman geography, the provinces of Kaṇḍahār and of Ghazni of existing geography)—that is to say, the parts of Afghanistan which lie east of the Sulimān chain of mountains.<br>This fact is established by the great trilingual inscription of Bisoutoun, which indicates the last eastern countries to which Dareios had carried his arms at the epoch when the monument was erected. This was before he had achieved his well-known conquest of the valley of the Indus.<br>—St. Martin, Étude sur la Géographie Grecque et Latine de l'Inde, pp. 14 seqq.]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/specials/quotes/greek/never_invaded.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/specials/quotes/greek/never_invaded.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 14:22:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[README]]></title><description><![CDATA[

He went to Gautama Haridrumata and said to him: “I wish to become your student, Sir – may I come to you, Sir?” He said to him: “Of what family are you, my friend?”
He replied: “I do not know, Sir, of what family I am. I asked my mother, and she answered – in my youth when I had to move about much as a servant, I conceived thee; I do not know of what family thou art; I am Jabala by name, thou art Satyakāma (analogous, Philalethes). I am therefore Satyakāma Jabala, Sir.
He said to him: “No one but a true Brāhmaṇa would speak so honestly. Go and fetch fuel, friend, I shall initiate you as a Brāhmaṇa. You have not swerved from the truth.”

On another occasion, Cāṇakya wished to test the youths, so while Candragupta was sleeping, he ordered Pabbata to remove his woolen thread without breaking it or waking the owner, which Pabbata was unable to do. When Candragupta was set the problem, however, he solved it after the manner of Alexander and the Gordian knot: he cut off Pabbata’s head, and Cāṇakya was not the man to be displeased at this.

(In Śākala) the women, drunk and naked, laugh and dance outdoors in the city; unadorned with garlands or unguents, they drunkenly sing various obscene songs that are as musical as a donkey’s bray or a camel’s bleat. They are without restraint in intercourse as in all other matters; in drunken madness they call each other various endearing epithets. Making drunk cries to their husbands, these fallen women give themselves up to dancing without observing restrictions even on sacred days.
What man would willingly dwell, even for a moment, among these fallen, depraved Bāhlīkas?
Crossing the Śatadru, returning to my own country, I await to cast my eyes again upon the beautiful women with thick frontal bones, with blazing stickers of red arsenic on their foreheads, with streaks of jet black collyrium on their eyes!

As a Professor loves his student, so may we love each other steadfastly and faithfully.
Distant though we were, one from the other, we stand now united. May we be of one mind and spirit! Through the grace of God, may the eyes radiate benevolence. Be thou my shield. May thou have a cheerful heart and a smiling face. May thou be a true devotee of God and mother of heroes. May thou have at heart the welfare of all living beings!
– Rig Veda 10.85.44-47

It was my hope that this would cause them to superstitiously believe that I was some sort of chosen hero.<br><br>Game 1. Emperor: Cāṇakya.<br>Round 1.<br>
Victim: Rājastambha.
Alibis: Suhavis for Sulabhin. Sulabhin for Suhavis.
Inferences: One of Sarpamālin, Śaśaloman is a spy OR Suhavis, Sulabhin are both spies.
Behavioural observations: Sulabhin’s surprise at Suhavis giving him an alibi seemed genuine. Unlikely for them to both be spies.
Emperor shows mercy. 
<br>Round 2.<br>
Victim: Sarpamālin.
Alibis: Śaśaloman for Suhavis. Suhavis for Sulabhin.
Inferences: Śaśaloman is a spy OR Suhavis and Sulabhin are both spies.
Behavioural observations: None.
Emperor executes Śaśaloman.
<br>Round 3 unnecessary as the surviving player would immediately be executed.<br>Loyalist victory.<br>Teachings: Omit information that incriminates yourself; do not kill the only other possible suspect.<br><br>Game 2. Emperor: Cāṇakya.<br>Round 1.<br>
Victim: Suhavis.
Alibis: Sulabhin for Rājastambha. 
Inferences: One of Sulabhin, Sarpamālin, Śaśaloman is a spy. One of Rājastambha, Sarpamālin, Śaśaloman is a spy (due to missing alibi).
Behavioural observations: None.
Emperor shows mercy. 
<br>Round 2.<br>
Victim: Sulabhin.
Alibis: Śaśaloman for Rājastambha. 
Inferences: One of Sarpamālin, Śaśaloman is a spy. One of Rājastambha, Sarpamālin is a spy.
Behavioural observations: The spy is taking my advice from the last game with regards to omitting self-incriminating evidence. Yet Rājastambha remains alive, despite being vouched for the previous round. While Sulabhin was an equally good target to kill, I do not believe the spy was clever enough to realize that I was also suspecting people on basis of the missing alibi. Upon interrogation, Rājastambha claimed: “I didn’t kill Sulabhin, I haven’t killed anyone.” I believe him; the dice have not given him the opportunity to kill yet.
Emperor executes Rājastambha.
<br>Round 3 unnecessary as the surviving player would immediately be executed.<br>Loyalist victory.<br>Teachings: Omitting information also makes you suspicious, decide wisely; more generally behave as a loyal would, make a full-fledged story that you yourself can believe.<br><br>Game 3. Emperor: Cāṇakya.<br>Round 1.<br>
Victim: Suhavis.
Alibis: Rājastambha for Sulabhin. Sulabhin for Rājastambha. Sarpamālin for Rājastambha.
Inference: One of Sarpamālin, Śaśaloman is a spy OR Rājastambha, Sulabhin are both spies. One of Rājastambha, Sulabhin, Sarpamālin is a spy (because of excess alibi).
Behavioural observations: None.
Emperor shows mercy.
<br>Round 2.<br>
Victim: Śaśaloman.
Alibis: Rājastambha for Sulabhin. Sulabhin for Rājastambha. Sarpamālin for Sulabhin.
Inference: Sarpamālin is a spy OR Rājastambha, Sulabhin are both spies.
Behavioural observations: Oh come on.
Emperor executes Rājastambha.
<br>Round 3 unnecessary as the surviving player would immediately be executed.<br>Loyalist victory.<br>Teachings: Don’t behave predictably; don’t do things that would be much more unlikely if you were innocent i.e. maintain plausible deniability; recognize that your opponent is intelligent too.<br><br>Character examination notes: Suhavis, Rājastambha and Sulabhin appear gullible, but Suhavis seems cowardly and uncreative. Rājastambha made an honest effort to learn what I taught him, even though his own attempts to execute failed. The latter fact demonstrates that he was not motivated by scholarly purpose, but by sympathy towards me. From his accent, he is not a native of Magadha, and is likely of Mathura; he is also of immense raw strength, which may be useful in close combat. Sarpamālin and Śaśaloman are of no use to me.]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/specials/rajamandala/with_guards.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/specials/rajamandala/with_guards.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2024 17:21:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[treaty]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>[date:-492|flashback,x]<br>“ … the next suitor for the hand in marriage of the unblemished princess Vapuṣmatī, whose radiant beauty knows no equal in history or in fiction, who was seized from the city of Champa upon the vanquishment of its rulers by the Great King Bimbisāra, the mightiest of the Magadhas, and indeed of all Kṣatriyas – is the fourth prince of Great King Bimbisāra, born of his queen Vajirakumari Chellana: Prince Ajātaśatru!”<br>Light ceremonial applause filled the arena, sounds of some vague positive chants – and Ajātaśatru strode in followed by what looked like a wheeled palanquin, pulled by two muscled attendants, and a cart containing several large rocks, pulled by four more attendants.<br>“I object to your faint appraisal of me,” said the prince, his eyes most serious and considering, “But it is no matter of importance. You have viewed some impressive feats of strength from my brothers and cousins – Kṣatravṛddha, who sliced through a Fir trunk in one blow as if its wood were softer than butter. Remarkable!”<br>He sent a flying kiss in the direction of his eldest brother, as if to clarify that all his words of praise were ironic. The crowd and courtiers shuffled uncomfortably, and Ajātaśatru’s own parents looked merely annoyed with his antics.<br>“But,” he continued, “I will show you something of far greater splendor, far greater beauty, far greater significance than any of the feats demonstrated by my brothers.”<br>Ajātaśatru’s attendant unveiled the most unusual device, that to the inquisitive faces in the audience appeared to be nothing more than a large spoon attached to some odd box-shaped contraption.<br>“Behold!” cried the prince, “The device of my own invention, the ejector of large stones, the Catapult!<br>“Kṣemravṛddhi says he can shatter a large boulder into fragments with four swings of his mace. How impressive! My device can turn an entire city wall to flour in the matter of minutes – wood and stone alike are defenceless against the might of my mind that I have materialized in this magnificent device.”<br>As a demonstration, his attendants slowly turned the catapult to its side to face an empty segment of the otherwise packed arena (for grand presentations of might always seemed to receive a large attendance in Magadha), loaded a stone from the cart into its magazine – and very ceremoniously, Ajātaśatru struck the device somewhere with a rod.<br>The steps of the arena chipped, and large cracks formed at the site of impact, and the women in the audience instinctively pressed their hands to their ears at the horrid crash that echoed through the bounds of the arena – Ajātaśatru fired again, and a large chunk broke off – and again, before King Bimbisāra finally beseeched him to end the demonstration, for the sake of the finances of rebuilding the arena if nothing else.<br>Ajātaśatru bowed to his father in thick irony. “I believe that should suffice as a demonstration of my might as well as of my many other qualities – that it should suffice to make your decision not only as to the groom for the maiden you would have taken for yourself if not for the jealousy of my mother and stepmothers—”<br>The king was furious, as were his queens and other princes.<br>“—but also as to your future heir, the future Lord of Magadha, who will bring this kingdom to heights not previously—”<br>“That is sufficient, son,” King Bimbisāra interrupted curtly. “This is a contest to find the man worthy of the war spoils that I have decided to donate out of the generosity of my heart, not of the throne of Magadha. But that is irrelevant: for you will be receiving neither.”<br>strength<br><br><br>
Strength is of three kinds: power of deliberation is intellectual strength; the possession of a prosperous treasury and a strong army is the strength of sovereignty; and martial power is physical strength.

 <br>[date:-492|flashback,x]<br>“Kṣatravṛddha can slice a tree in one blow, how impressive!” Ajātaśatru’s voice dripped with indignance. “Do you know what else can uproot a tree in one blow? An elephant! Do you know what an elephant cannot do? This!”<br>He struck his contraption again, sending a rock hurling past the palatial walls and crashing somewhere out of vision with a noise that was still deafening.<br>“Truly, I do not comprehend what you believe your great feat is, son,” said King Bimbisāra. “You merely struck a latch. It is your assistants who are doing the heavy work.”<br>Ajātaśatru stumbled, astonished by his own father’s stupidity.<br>“Does the strength of my intellect mean nothing to you, father?” he pleaded.<br>It was Bimbisāra’s most trusted advisor, an Ājīvaka monk by the name of Varṣākāra, that answered.<br>“If it is your scholarship that you wish to be respected for, young prince,” he suggested, his voice soft, “Perhaps you ought to seek refuge in one of the Western realms, like Vaiśālī, Kāśī, Ayodhya, Mathura, even Takṣaśilā—”<br>“Ah yes!” cried Ajātaśatru. “The Vedic lands! Where the Brāhmaṇas, who brag about their incredible scholarship, believe that archery is really about building bridges out of arrows, that the hallmark of a great archer is the ability to shoot an arrow at the sky and make it rain! Yes, perhaps THERE I will be respected for my strategic acumen and my ingenuity at creating military technologies.”<br>“I studied at Takṣaśilā,” Varṣākāra tried to argue. “And even as I have many differences with the ways of the Brāhmaṇas, you are being unfair in your assessment of them, as you are in your critique of your own people.”<br>“Or perhaps you are a clown who does not comprehend my genius,” Ajātaśatru spat at the ground.<br>“Perhaps,” Varṣākāra admitted. “Perhaps you are ahead of your time.”<br>This seemed to invoke a new fervour in Ajātaśatru, who threw the key of his catapult towards the ground and unsheathed his sword.<br>“History is littered with the corpses of forgotten men who were ahead of their time,” he muttered, his face red.<br>Ajātaśatru then strode towards the pedestal upon which Princess Vapuṣmatī was tied, slashed through her chains with his sword, and kissed her lips with cutting rage.<br>The crowd gasped; the king, the queens and princes, the army and all were completely thrown off, if they hadn’t been already, finding themselves in a rather unusual situation and not having a faintest instinct for how to react; the other princes unsheathed their swords, and Vapuṣmatī was shaking, terrified, by the civil war that was unfurling around her between the Magadhi princes.<br>Ajātaśatru spoke loud and clear: “Allow me to defile the sanctity of this entire ceremony by saying the following words: the woman you believe is now your wife, my dear brother, has already been enjoyed by me! Not only this, Kṣatravṛddha: the evening prior to this contest, she cried into my arms, proclaiming her undying affection for me, telling me that she would forever hold me to be her Lord, regardless of Father’s unwise judgement in today’s contest.”<br>Vapuṣmatī was sobbing.<br>The noble family and everyone else was at a loss for words.<br>Kṣatravṛddha charged with a guttural cry of fury, brandishing his sword.<br>It was not clear if he meant to attack Ajātaśatru or the princess, but Ajātaśatru certainly made no effort to defend her.<br>“Kṣatravṛddha!” cried Queen Kosala Devi at her son, breaking out of her stupor, and the said prince stopped in his tracks, fuming in indignance.<br>“But if despite all your pretenses, brother,” Ajātaśatru continued, striking his own sword against the ground, heedless to the hurt that his words caused to the woman who hailed him as her savior, “You are yet willing to marry a woman defiled by me, then I shall myself throw her at your feet. Truly, I care very little for her myself, and only took her to spite you, the favourite son of our idiot father.”<br>“Ajātaśatru!” cried Queen Chellana, deciding to put an end to her own son’s tirade. “If what you say is true, you have committed a grave crime against the chastity of this maiden, against the honour of your brother, against the honour of our tribe—”<br>“YOU speak to me of honour and chastity?” snapped Ajātaśatru. “YOU, mother? You were a princess of Vaiśālī, and yet you married a barbarian man whom you despised in order to secure his favour towards your kingdom. There is a word we have, for women who sell their bodies in exchange for favours!”<br>Bimbisāra’s eyes were colder than the iciest peaks of the Himalayas. Queen Chellana rose, shocked beyond words to so much as chastise her son—<br>“And was it not a grave crime against the chastity of this maiden to murder her family before her eyes?” Ajātaśatru continued, a perverted grimace on his face, “To chain her and parade her through the streets of Rajagriha, to announce to every beggar and criminal of this country that he too may have an opportunity to make her his sex slave if he can chop down a tree in one hit?”<br>“Enough!” cried King Bimbisāra.<br>But Ajātaśatru continued.<br>“Do you know how I would chop down a tree, father?”<br>He held out his left hand, and one of his attendants scrambled over, bowing before him and bestowing him with a bag of jingling coins. Ajātaśatru then strode towards Kṣatravṛddha, unbothered by the unsheathed sword in eldest prince’s hands, and tossed the coins in his brother’s face, letting them scatter onto the ground.<br>Ignoring his brother’s indignant cries, Ajātaśatru hollered across the arena:<br>“I would pay my brother – or one of the thousands of other young fools in this kingdom whose strength equals or exceeds his – the small sum of money that he is worth, and take him as my slave. Indeed, much as you purchased your wives, father!”<br>“Enough,” King Bimbisāra said again, his voice more authoritative than before. “I have allowed this insanity to progress for far too long. This is a svayaṃvara, not an auction, and Princess Vapuṣmatī is a bride, not a sex slave.”<br>Ajātaśatru folded his hands and gave an exaggerated bow, preparing to leave.<br>Not one person said a word – not the king, not the minister, not the queens, not the princes, and certainly not any of the attendees. The only human sounds that could be heard – if it was even regarded as that – were the sniffles of Princess Vapuṣmatī, who knew not of what would be done with her.<br>They were too thrown off by the bizarreness of his rant and of his antics, and for the most part were just grateful to have him go.<br>Ajātaśatru picked up the key that he had earlier tossed to the ground in rage—<br>—and struck the device with one mighty blow, launching a boulder straight at the balcony that housed the royal attendees—<br>—the balcony separated from the rest of the palace—<br>—and crashed into the ground, inclusive of its inhabitants and of the shards of the stone that had shattered against it.<br>The crowd screamed, too shocked to begin to even process the far-reaching consequences of what had just occurred before their very eyes, to even process whether they ought to flee for their own lives. The imperial guard started yelling contradictory orders, and some rushed towards the site of the collapse.<br>A growl sounded, and King Bimbisāra’s arm rose from underneath the rubble, pulling himself out.<br>His booming voice came out like his body, bloody and broken:<br>“Capture the traitor!”<br>Some of the Imperial Guard had surrounded Ajātaśatru, but they were too frightened, and too out of protocol to know what to do.<br>“As you command, Great King,” said a squadron of the Imperial Guards to Bimbisāra, and arrested him.]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/vasudeva/1.2_rebels.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/vasudeva/1.2_rebels.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2024 19:40:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[1.3_coup]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Some princes were slain, others escaped taking heavy casualties to their own guards and demoralized the faction still loyal to Bimbisāra, and Ajātaśatru immediately ordered the execution of that faction.<br>Several of his closest allies rushed towards him and created a platform to raise him on their shields.

The crowd watches him intensely, slightly uncomfortable, slightly confused and slightly petrified. Gradually, he raises one hand into the air and lets out a bored cry.)<br>Ah, yes – thank you! Thank you … to who? Yes … to me! From all your wives! You impotent husbands of prostitutes.<br>No, that is not what I meant to say. But it is true. You know what else is true? Varṣākāra sings as he bathes! He says they are holy chants, but the Ājīvakas do not have holy chants, do they? And even if they did, I am sure he is just inclined towards music and being merry. You know who else was inclined towards music and being merry? My father! And he is dead now!<br>(The king laughs uncontrollably for a full half-minute. The crowd is frozen in shock, and Varṣākāra is trembling..)<br>I jest, I jest – he’s just in prison..<br>Oh yes … that reminds me … my father … I wanted to do something to him.<br>Kill him? No, not yet.<br>Torture him? I’m already doing that.<br>Thank him! Ah yes … that’s what I wanted to say.<br>Thank you, Father, O mighty King Bimbisāra, the former Lord of the Magadhas – for if not for your seed I would not exist. But then again, neither would my idiot brothers, so is that truly so bad? Yes it is, I am simply that important. No, that’s not why I wanted to thank him. But I must say I do not resemble my father in the slightest. Is there something I must know, Mother? Was there a more intelligent, less lazy Vaiśālī man than my father? I mean, yes, all of them, but I am not certain when you would have had the time to commit such an atrocity—<br>(The king makes an obscene gesture.)<br>—however justifiable it may be, to circumcise my father so. From what I know, he did nothing but laze and frolick with his wives like a depraved dog until I urged him to invade Anga.<br>Yes! That is what I wanted to thank him for. For conquering Anga! Even though it was I who did so, truly. Forgive me, Vapuṣmatī, my queen – I did not wish to slay your family so, I did not wish you to be treated in the manner you were – although I did wish to treat you in such manner. Which I did.<br>(The king laughs. The queen makes a shy gesture to protect the image of her chastity. A courtier laughs along with the king, and is beheaded on the spot.)<br>Yes, thank you, father!–Can you hear me from your prison?– for crushing all those petty rebellions. For conquering all those petty tribes. So I can focus on the real task at hand: the conquest of all Āryāvarta!]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/vasudeva/1.4_coronation.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/vasudeva/1.4_coronation.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2024 19:40:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[1.5_birth]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>[date:-481|flashback,x]<br>The eleven-year-old Ekanamsha looked up at her mother with bubbly eyes. “Mother,” she asked, pausing her knitting for a half-minute. “How did you and Father marry?”<br>Her twin brother Vāsudeva let out an exaggerated yawn from behind the cotton-paper manuscripts that he was scouring over, earning a disapproving look from Mother Devaki.<br>“Your father won my hand in marriage at my svayaṃvara,” Devaki explained, reminiscing with a smile, “He had to defeat my many suitors, many of whom were princes and nobles – to prove to my father and I that he was most worthy of me, and that there was nothing more he desired in the world than me.”<br>“You can’t prove a falsehood,” remarked Vāsudeva with snarky amusement.<br>“VA̅SUDEVA!” his mother objected.<br>Vāsudeva put down his book. “Forgive me, mother, I did not mean to belittle the affection between you and Father. But there was NOTHING more he desired? REALLY? If there was NOTHING more he desired, why did he not just poison all your other suitors?”<br>“VA̅SUDEVA!” Devaki cried again, but Father (Vasudeva) was guffawing.<br>“What? There are many poisons that would go undetected in an autopsy.”<br>“But would it not be suspicious if all the other suitors mysteriously died the day before the svayaṃvara?” Ekanamsha asked innocently.<br>Devaki started: “Ekanamsha that is NOT the reason, that is NOT the point I am trying—”<br>“Then he could have just poisoned those suitors who were sufficiently skilful to have a decent chance of defeating him. And perhaps undersell his own abilities prior to the date so as to not make it seem that all those who were stronger than him were dead. By the way, Father, what is the meaning of this word?”<br>As Vasudeva peered into Vāsudeva’s book and explained the function of the mentioned surgical instrument, Devaki looked very cross at her son’s line of questioning.<br>“Vāsudeva … ” she said tiredly, “This is the sort of thing for which we are sending you to Sage Saṃkarṣaṇa’s gurukula.”<br>“YOU ARE SENDING ME AWAY? You will send your only child away?” (Ekanamsha glared at him)<br>“Sage Saṃkarṣaṇa is a foremost expert on ethics and virtue,” Vasudeva explained supportively. “For all your brilliance, my son, I believe that you are in necessity of an education on these matters.”<br>“No! I do not believe you SHOULD have poisoned your other suitors – I’m merely saying that the fact that you didn’t, shows that there are other values you hold more sacred than Mother, like non-killing! I am not denying morals, I am pointing out the immoral present in MOTHER’S words, I’m EXPLAINING ethics! Sage Saṃkarṣaṇa needn’t teach me, I MYSELF am an expert on ethics!”<br>“Vāsudeva, you are being far too arrogant–”<br>“I do not need instruction to understand why poisoning your competitors is wrong! You didn’t need instruction to understand that – everyone understands that! Well, I suppose a barbarian might not, but a barbarian will also not be knowledgeable about the different types of poisons that may be used.”<br>“An intelligent barbarian,” Ekanamsha mused. “Where have we ever seen one of those?”<br>“Are you referring to the wicked new King of Magadha?” Vāsudeva questioned.<br>“No, brother, I’m referring to YOU!”]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/vasudeva/2.1_childhood.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/vasudeva/2.1_childhood.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2024 09:02:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[2.2_licchavi]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>[date:-480|flashback,x]<br>The king of Magadha laughed. Not a wicked sort of laugh that one may have expected from the caricatures of him in plays – a jovial and genuine laugh of amusement.<br>“I don’t know why you ever sent me a messenger, Great King,” he said lightly, addressing his rival, “I made my goals quite clear to you from the start, did I not? What would your messenger have negotiated?”<br>The Licchavi Chief smiled nervously.<br>“For that matter, what have you come to talk about?” Ajātaśatru continued. “I could kill you right now, you know, just as I did to the messenger,” —the Licchavis unsheathed their swords and acted offended; Ajātaśatru ignored them and addressed the courtiers— “What would you do about it? I’m the messenger now. Ooh don’t shoot the messenger! But what if the messenger shoots you? I jest, I jest. War between us will not benefit anybody. Besides me.” The Magadhi king bared his teeth.<br>Trying not to look appalled, the Licchavi Chief folded his hands: “Great King … I have come to surrender to you.”<br>“Oh? Could you not have just killed yourself? Please do not be offended! I would quite enjoy murdering you myself, Great King, but I am quite the busy man, you know.”<br>The Magadhi chortled heartily, his courtiers laughing alongside him, while his rival was sweating. He turned to the Licchavi Minister.<br>“Ah, Chief Minister!” he cried. “How stoic your face is – how manlily you stand! You must be so intelligent, so firm, so righteous! And yet you lose to me – a short Magadhi barbarian who regards himself a genius for having invented one intrigue, while in the Western realms, educated Brāhmaṇas like yourself revel in the study of hundreds of such devices of their own invention! Do you wish to know why, Chief Minister? Do you wish to know my secret – why I win, and you lose?”<br>The Chief Minister did not answer.<br>Ajātaśatru continued.<br>“Everywhere from Vaiśālī to Takṣaśilā, the Brāhmaṇas present themselves as the manly, decisive, realist defenders of Vedic civilization – of great ingenuity and strong morals – with a grand master-plan, to be playing an elaborate and complicated game, so that every loss is truly a step to an eventual victory – that they will never allow the great civilization of their construction to fall to a deranged lunatic like myself.”<br>–he pointed at his own ridiculous wolf-skin outfit–<br>“Beware the wolf in sheep’s skin, they say! But I say: beware the sheep in wolf’s skin! Beware a man who possesses no goals but takes false glory from the appearance of a cunning, ambitious genius! That is all that most men are: sheep! and it is cheap to pretend – and pretending to be a wolf gives you all the benefits you desire: the vulvas of well-endowed women, social respect, some royal titles and grants – mainly the vulvas of well-endowed women – but the achievement of no real goals in life. And that is the reason why I win and you lose–”<br>The Magadhi king’s expression turned sombre, and he made an exaggerated gesture of clutching his temple with his forefingers and sniffling.<br>“–because you truly do not even care about defeating me! You care about appearing to care about defeating me – because that speaks well of your sense of judgement of what ought to be, whether that signal is true or false.”<br>Ajātaśatru sniffled some more, then punched his own minister in the face to address him.<br>“Do you want to know what I care about, Varṣākāra? Showing what, for once, a wolf – not even in sheep’s clothing – in wolf’s clothing–” he drew attention to his own attire “–can accomplish in a world of sheep. And that lesson, however expensive or destructive it may be, will be greatly beneficial to the world!”<br>“Will it?” asked a courtier. Varṣākāra sighed internally as the king of Magadha sliced the annoyance in two.<br>“Will it?” Ajātaśatru mimicked. “I DON’T KN— I DON’T CARE if it is beneficial! That was a lie! I spoke, in very clear terms, about what I cared about: showing what one wolf can accomplish in a world of sheep. If that is all I care about, obviously I’m lying when I say that is motivated by an even deeper desire to benefit the world. Oh, but Ajātaśatru, why did you lie? Why did you put on a pretense, why did you flash some sheep skin for a moment? Because I knew some idiot would say WILL IT REALLY? and I could then make an example out of him, and go on this whole rant; there are so many levels to my thinking, too deep for all your small intellects to comprehend, thus furthering my goal of demonstrating what a wolf can do in a world of sheep—” he gestured to those seated around him, “—Oh, and maybe I should just behead all of you, because you just believed the explanation I gave you for what I said and did, believed that I truly anticipated and predicted the reaction in advance and plotted it all, much like the foolish Licchavi Chief who believed this about his Minister, and now you do not know what to believe, thus furthering my goal of demonstrating what a wolf can do in a world of sheep.”<br>The king guffawed amusedly.<br>And then his expression turned serious.<br>“You know,” he said, “I’m very sad. Very lonely. When I ascended the throne of Magadha, I fantasized about fighting great wars, playing games of intrigue against intellects equal to my own in cunning and strategic acumen – to outsmart such minds and dominate them – to earn my victory, rather than simply have it be handed to me. But if my opponent’s goal is not to win at all, then what even is the game?”<br>Ajātaśatru beheaded the Licchavi Chief, whose allies rose in protest but quickly found themselves restrained by the Magadhas.<br>Forcing a smile, he asked no-one in particular: “But did I plan for that?”]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/vasudeva/2.2_licchavi.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/vasudeva/2.2_licchavi.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2024 19:40:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[2.3_mother]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>[date:-475|flashback,x]<br>“And then what did you do, Father-sir?”<br>“Luring them into a false sense of security by feigning defeat, I sent a group of prostitutes to distract Kulvalaka and the other Licchavis and break the chain of command, allowing my agents to seize the city before their confused eyes.”<br>“Brilliant, Father-sir!”<br>“That is NOT what you should be saying, Udayin. What should you be saying?”<br>Udayin considered the question for a half-second. “The prostitutes achieved what your catapults couldn’t. Thus, they are a threat to your supremacy.” The crown prince gulped. “What did you do to them, Father-sir?”<br>Ajātaśatru scrunched up his face as if confused by the question. “Why, I simply beheaded them, of course. It would be quite silly to employ a more torturous method – like cutting them into small shreds starting from the fingertips, or pouring molten metal down their throat, or chaining their limbs to those of elephants and having them slowly be torn apart, or placing them between spiked plates as they are pressed together by boulders dropped by cranes. Those are the methods to be employed against my enemies or against ordinary subjects for fun, not against those who have served me – I wouldn’t want my subjects afraid of serving me, after all.”<br>One could sense some nervousness in Udayin’s laugh, and this annoyed the Emperor to no end, but he decided against beating his son this time. This time, he would use Udayin’s favourite sex slave before his eyes – yes, that would be an appropriate punishment.<br>When the silence was finally broken, it was by Queen-Mother Chellana.<br>Ajātaśatru, upon being coronated, had shown mercy upon his own mother – while he had imprisoned his father and had been subjecting him to regular torture for the past seventeen years, the former queens had been shown much kindness: he generously employed his brothers’ mothers as prostitutes for the most distinguished commanders and champions in his armies, while his own mother, for her kind act of birthing him, was allowed to roam the palace freely and continued to enjoy her former chamber (of course, she had also been caned severely during the purge as a warning against making too many annoying moralizing chastisements against the king).<br>“There is a request I wish to make, son,” she said weakly. Ajātaśatru noticed that she had been crying – probably something to do with how he had just mercilessly massacred her old relations in Vaiśālī. Oh, but Ajātaśatru, you’re my son, you shouldn’t murder my cousins! You shouldn’t raze my city to the ground and go around suffocating its aristocrats by chaining them to the bottom of a pit and slowly pouring wet sand over them! Typical woman.<br>“Go on,” the king said with a sigh. He was quite kind that way.<br>“I have asked this of you, before, son … but I hope that you will grant me my boon this time … at least seeing your mother in this distraught state … ”<br>“This again? OH, I WANT TO SEE MY HUSBAND AGAIN, I’M LONELY, AND ALL MY SON TALKS ABOUT IS MURDERING PROSTITUTES AND MONKS. If you so desperately wish for a man’s company, Mother, then Varṣākāra is exhibiting his endowments quite publicly.”<br>Queen-Mother Chellana covered her face in horror.<br>Ajātaśatru ignored her.<br>“Son … if you ever felt that your father and I did not treat you well when you were young, that we did not respect your talents as we should have … then it is not your father you should blame … it is me.”<br>Ajātaśatru rolled his eyes. “The typical self-sacrifice. Ah, yes, it was my mother who preferred the sons of her husband’s other wives – if that is so, Mother, then I must say I have even less respect for you now than before—”<br>“I threw you into the garbage dump when you were born, son!” Queen-Mother Chellana was sobbing.<br>“When you were conceived, I had these horrid dreams – of consuming my husband’s heart – I never dreamed of doing any harm, of course, just … I went to a seer and asked him what these dreams meant, and he told me it meant my son would have the heart of a monster, cold, wicked and devoid of any compassion. That he would feel neither remorse nor disgust at even cannibalism, and that there was no method of nurture that would change this, it was predetermined … ”<br>Ajātaśatru’s expression was blank.<br>“I couldn’t bring myself to abort you. I just couldn’t … you were my son. To do such a thing would be a betrayal of your father’s love for me, and an insult to mine for him. And yet when you were born, when I saw the eyes of the monster you were prophesied to become, the monster I had brought into this world … I … I … ”<br>A weaker man would have accused: It is YOUR fault that I grew up to be a monster, Mother! What else would you expect from a child who was treated by his own mother as a freak of prophecy? The prophecy was self-fulfilling – the only reason it was made because the monk knew what sort of a depraved woman you were, and predicted the outcome of your upbringing.<br>But not Ajātaśatru. For it was irrelevant what factors had influenced him to become the way he was – for all it mattered, a butterfly could have flapped its wings and altered the course of history to cause him to be born, but he had no cause to honour that butterfly. Whatever he was, it was the product of his own decisions, and those decisions were the product of what his personality had been before. Further causation was irrelevant.<br>And he was proud of what he was.<br>“Your father heard of what I had done, and dived into the garbage dump himself to find his beloved child, for that is what you’ve always been to him, whether or not he showered you with the requisite affection. When he found you, you were wounded and sickly, having been picked and bitten by various filthy animals, covered with ashes … and you had a boil on your finger. Your father is, as you say, a barbarian – he did not know how to treat the boil, or to bring you to a medical practitioner. So he took your finger in his mouth and sucked the pus out of it himself, caring not even for his own life, caring only for the slightest chance that his son survives.”<br>The king’s eyes were red.<br>“That is the truth of your father, son. He cared for you like he cared for no other person in the world.”<br>“Is … is that so?” Ajātaśatru’s acting was so natural, that anyone who was not already familiar with his nature and behaviour would not have been able to even tell that it was a façade. “I never knew, mother. I … I will go and free him immediately.”<br>Queen-Mother Chellana’s eyes widened in horror, but Ajātaśatru was gone before she could protest.]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/vasudeva/2.3_mother.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/vasudeva/2.3_mother.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2024 19:40:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[2.4_father]]></title><description><![CDATA[

His one remaining eye opened slowly to behold his son, whose face shone with kindness towards his father for the first time in the forty years of his life.<br>“… son?”<br>The king helped his father up, and continued to hold him when he realized the old man could not stand.<br>“Mother told me everything. About my birth. And who rescued me.”<br>“Yes … Varṣākāra was quite fond of you.”<br>Ajātaśatru’s face turned stone-cold.<br>“He risked his life for you … did she tell you about the boil on your finger—”<br>Bimbisāra screamed and begged, flailed like a chicken being dragged to slaughter, with more energy than he had mustered in over a decade – as Ajātaśatru dragged him by what remained of his scalp-hair, and nailed his hands and feet to wooden planks.<br>“You lying, lying hypocrites,” he spat, then mimicked: “Oh, he cared for you like no other person— lies! All. Blatant. Lies!”<br>The Emperor of Magadha grabbed his sword and slashed at his father’s frail body, relishing in the whimpers that came out of the aged man’s face.<br>“LOOK HOW QUICKLY YOU TURNED WHEN I OFFERED YOU MERCY!

YOU STUPID, STUPID ANIMAL—”<br>Slash.<br>“—I WILL MAKE YOU WISH FOR YOUR KNEES TO BUCKLE, FOR THE BLISS OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS – I WILL MAKE YOU WISH FOR DEATH!”<br>Slash.<br>Bimbisāra would have vomited, if he had eaten anything in the past six days.<br>Ajātaśatru dropped his torch into the slammer and sealed it shut, blocking out the depraved noises and coughs that came out of his father.<br>At dinner, the Emperor made five announcements.<br>First (and he said this as he thrashed Varṣākāra as he often did to vent his anger), in tragic news, his father was found dead in his cell, having just killed himself. His poor, poor father had seen his son approaching to free him, and thought: he is surely visiting to kill me! and committed suicide to spare his son of the sin of patricide.<br>Second (and this was said between Queen-Mother Chellana’s hysterical sobs), Queen-Mother Vajirakumari Chellana would be granted her wish of being reunited with her husband.<br>Third (and this was said as Queen-Mother Chellana’s bloodied body was carried out of the room by servants), Udayin – who had so far been known to be a very poor shot as an archer – was now skilled enough to practice archery on ornaments placed on the heads of live people, and Varṣākāra had been chosen for this honour.<br>Fourth (and this was said as Varṣākāra’s flailing self was dragged out of the room), adding to the tragedies – and this was known to no one else yet – Chief Queen Vapuṣmatī had succumbed to mysterious injuries and died in her cell. Yet another accident in the royal harem.<br>Fifth (and this was said to an increasedly worried audience in an atmosphere that had considerably darkened), as a result of all these tragedies, the Rajagriha palace now appeared to be ridden with only sorrow for him, and the capital was to be shifted to the nearby town of Pāṭaliputra; preparations would be underway immediately.<br>“Oh,” said Ajātaśatru, his ears perking up like he had just remembered something, “Right – the fourth thing hasn’t happened yet. Ha, it is as if I just spoiled the ending of a play for you! I’ll be right back.”]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/vasudeva/2.4_father.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/vasudeva/2.4_father.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2024 19:40:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[2.5_wife]]></title><description><![CDATA[

If you are truly the most powerful king in the world, and I your queen, then why, in all these years, have I seen nothing but the inside of a dungeon smelling of horse faeces?”<br>“More pretences that I am expected to uphold! Some kings build a palace the size of a city for their queens, I’ll keep mine in a cage with rats and flies. Say another thing that annoys me and I will have to dispose of you.”<br>“Really, you’ll dispose of me, my Lord?” Vapuṣmatī batted her eyelashes seductively.<br>“You are beginning to annoy me once more, my Queen.”<br>“Will you truly have the heart to let go of a beauty such as mine?”<br>“That beauty is fading already, and will last barely four or five more years. Your annoying nature will persist for much longer, if I do nothing about it.”<br>Vapuṣmatī laughed at first, then seemed to turn a little uncomfortable as Ajātaśatru stayed silent.<br>“ … you jest … right?”<br>It was when Ajātaśatru unsheathed his dagger that her discomfort turned into fear, to desperation, and finally to dread.<br>“My Lord … my Ruler … you know the affection that I have for you, how much respect I hold for you in my mind, and in reality … I beseech you, you are the hero who saved me, who won me … I beseech you, my Lord—”<br>Stab.<br>“And how am I to know that this is any different from my father’s supposed affection for me when he needed something out of me?” The Emperor’s voice was not cruel, merely cold and emotionless, and that only made it all much worse.<br>“I beseech you, my Lord … there is no one in these three worlds who knows you, who understands you like I do … and while even the gods worship you, they do not do so with the same devotion that I have toward you. It is not death that I fear, it is the betrayal – you know me – your company is all I have ever desired in life … I beg you, do not take that away from me.”<br>But all her pleas fell on deaf ears. Ajātaśatru sucked the life force of his beloved queen from the gash that he had made on her neck, and the lifeless body of the only person who had ever been an anchor to his insanity fell limply to the ground, covered in dead tears.]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/vasudeva/2.5_wife.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/vasudeva/2.5_wife.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 21:33:48 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[2.6_letter]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>O Dīrghachāryaṇa, most illustrious scholar of the sixteen great kingdoms,<br>I have no cause to intimate you of Ajātaśatru’s plans of invading your prosperous country – you are surely already aware of this, as he has made his intentions very clear to anyone who cares to hear him. I am writing to you, in secret, rather than to be read in the court of Ayodhya, for I seek to forge an alliance with you – not with the king of Ayodhya, but with you directly.<br>Ordinary alliances are made on the basis of mutual interest, but I make a far costlier request from you: I ask that we forge an alliance, not for the interests of our respective kingdoms, but for the interest of Vedic civilization at large. For the goal of protecting the Vedas and the Civilized Tongue, the sciences, the culture of free thought and chaste behaviour – from the barbarism that is Ajātaśatru’s expanding empire.<br>We cannot regard this as a mere conflict between kingdoms. As a conflict between ideas, I fear that this will be only the first of centuries of war. This is why I choose to speak with you, rather than to the king, for as a Brāhmaṇa, your service, beyond your capacity as Chief Minister of Ayodhya, is to the preservation of civilization.<br>It was unwise of Ayodhya and Vaiśālī to swap daughters in marriage to forge alliances with Magadha – unwise to trust the Magadhas so. I am afraid that Ayodhya’s nobility has become too invested in this alliance to consider my suggestions – that the wisdom and the glory of the ancient Raghu line is lost on the current king, this is why I choose to speak with you.<br>I believe that Ajātaśatru, as he has already taken Vaiśālī, will first attack your vassals in Kāśī, insisting on maintaining your alliance through some technical pretexts that the king will accept out of laziness or lack of foresight – then once he has consolidated power there, he will seize Ayodhya itself.<br>He must be stopped before he reaches Mathura. I request your co-operation in all matters.<br>Krishna.]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/vasudeva/2.6_letter.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/vasudeva/2.6_letter.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 21:43:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[2.7_ayodhya_1]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>[date:-465|flashback,x]<br>That morning in the city altar of Ayodhya, a sheep was sacrificed.<br>Emperor Ajātaśatru received the news that the city’s king had been deposed by its Prime Minister, a certain Dīrghachāryaṇa.<br>“What is the message that they are sending us?” Prince Udayin thought aloud. “That they celebrate the destruction of their sheep-like administration, and welcome our rule? Or that their sheep of a king has been eliminated, and their new administration will be more effective in countering us?”<br>Ajātaśatru was annoyed by the question.<br>“It is irrelevant, my son,” he replied. “What it means is that their new administration is just as sheep-like and foolish as the previous. For if they were truly wolves, if they were truly my worthy enemies – or allies – they would not bother sending me any sort of message – much less a cryptic, poetic and meaningless one. The purpose of the ritual is not to send me any message of meaning, it is to IMPRESS me.”<br>“And even in that purpose, they have failed,” Udayin commented.<br>Yet, Ajātaśatru could not quite shake off the fear that he was, for the first time, fighting a mind equal to his own – not only in sheer intellect, but also in cunning and ambition.<br>Upon conquering Vaiśālī, Ajātaśatru had set his eyes on the patchwork of an empire that was Ayodhya’s: the supposed lion of the jungle, before whose sovereign’s very sandals the monarchs of the world bowed to. He had first urged the tribes of the Daṇḍaka forest to rebel against the rule of their region by South Kosala, the tributary established so many centuries ago by the famous Rāma of Ayodhya. To do so, he had sought the aid of Vidarbha, a distant Southern kingdom, and had Rukmiṇī, the princess of Vidarbha, betrothed to Śiśupāla, a chief of wild tribes who was Ajātaśatru’s puppet.<br>Shortly thereafter, Princess Rukmini had been mysteriously kidnapped, with clearly fabricated incriminating evidence of an inside-job by her father. This had left Ajātaśatru with two options: to forgive the Vidarbhas and appear weak to his own followers, or to sabotage his alliance with them.<br>But Ajātaśatru was not a fool who merely responded to circumstances – he was creative, he was intelligent, and he played on his own terms. Thus, he had sent spies to find the true culprits, and to locate Princess Rukmini – and had found her in Ayodhya under the care of Prime Minister Dīrghachāryaṇa. But rather than taking the obvious bait – of accusing Dīrghachāryaṇa, having him dismissed from employment and giving the Brāhmaṇas cause to rebel against the king and install a prince in Ayodhya less sympathetic to Magadha – he had chosen to instead plant false evidence incriminating the King of Ujjain, a faraway and irrelevant country, in Rukmini’s abduction.<br>However, it appeared that whoever he was playing the game against had anticipated even this, and planning yet another step in advance, had caused a regime change in Ujjain – placing on its throne an indignant, ambitious hothead by the name of Pradyota, who was so enraged by the accusation against him that he marched his army to Magadha, set waste to its countryside and seized large treasures, then returned to invade and conquer Vidarbha. It had not done Ajātaśatru well to earn the ire of Pradyota, who had now apparently become a rival empire-builder of his own, and had began to compete with him for the alliance of Ayodhya.<br>At last, after seven long years, Ajātaśatru had taken Kāśī with his own forces – and enslaving its population to fill his army once more, declared war on the centre of civilization itself: on the city of Ayodhya, the capital of the nation that had once dominated the Mahājanapadas like a lion among lesser beasts.<br>Through his march through their country, his army had been harassed by thieves, skirmishers, poisoning attempts and seers and spies sent to demoralize the superstitious members of his army. And after spending three years capturing strategic forts and defeating armies sent to intercept him, three years of dealing with unending guerrilla warfare – he had finally reached the frontiers of the city of Ayodhya itself, ready to cross its uncrossable moat, to penetrate its impregnable bounds, to scale its unscalable walls and conquer the invincible city.<br>The resistance put up by the city was unlike anything that Ajātaśatru had seen in any fort he had captured previously – and unlike anything he had expected from an enemy.<br>For every attack, the city launched a most creative and unusual defence or counter-attack – they had captured some of his mechanics to learn the secret of the catapult, and created, in response, a more powerful bow – the crossbow – based on the identical technology and mounted it on their walls to harass the invading army. When Ajātaśatru battered their walls with his catapults, they reinforced it with rawhides and metal fibres to soften his blows; when he attempted to burn their fortifications by launching jugs of oil and fire-arrows at them, they repurposed their oil cauldrons – which were designed to be used against siege towers – to hurl water down the walls and extinguish the fires; when the Magadhas took advantage of lowered visibility from the smoke and steam to charge the doors with armoured elephants equipped with battering rams, the defenders located them with sound. The Magadhas sowed confusion by beating drums, but even when they made a hole in the wall at last, the insides were defended – not by archers as Ajātaśatru had anticipated, but by fiery traps that instantly killed the invaders; when Ajātaśatru sent in soldiers in wet clothing to avoid the flames, the fiery traps were supplemented by spike traps.<br>The Emperor of the Magadhas was impressed.<br>“Are we doomed?” asked his foolish son.<br>Ajātaśatru laughed. “Our goal is not to win a battle, silly boy. Our goal is the extermination of the people of Ayodhya – and there are many means to accomplish this. We employ this method because it is the most fun.”<br>All across civilized world – from the University at Takṣaśilā to the Port at Tāmraliptī, from the snowy mountains in the North to the ordinary ones in the South, in royal courts and in the Annual Debates in Yājñavalkya’s honour, in the camps of the defenders and the attackers alike, a mysterious name formed on the lips of men.]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/vasudeva/2.7_ayodhya_1.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/vasudeva/2.7_ayodhya_1.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 16:33:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[2.7_ayodhya_2]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>[date:-461|flashback,x]<br>After four full years of siege, Ayodhya fell.<br>More holes were made in the walls of Ayodhya; more sections became controlled by the invaders as defending them all became a war on too many fronts.<br>Pradyota of Ujjain, whose assistance had been requested by Ayodhya, found himself embroiled in a civil war against a rebellious Vidarbha. When the rebellion had finally been suppressed, the Magadhas put ruin to the roads from his country, stalling him.<br>The armies of Ayodhya continued to put a fierce resistance to Ajātaśatru even upon the breach of their walls – almost as if their goal was not victory itself, but merely to destroy as much of the Magadhi army as possible. As if they wished for the destruction of their own army, only so that it did not become Magadha’s when they were inevitably defeated.<br>“Your arrogance will be your downfall!” cried Dīrghachāryaṇa as he was tortured before the city’s central shrine.<br>“Arrogance, arrogance! – the three worlds chant without end: arrogance!” Ajātaśatru laughed heartily, “I’ve become a monster, and I love it! Why? Because I’ve become the greatest of them – all your tales, all your plays will be edited in due time to make arrogance the antagonist’s greatest weakness. All your villains will be moulded on me, and my personality, due to my wickedness. I love it!”<br>Ordinarily, Ajātaśatru would have dismissed Ayodhya’s actions as an irrational display of false bravery – but having experienced his enemy’s genius for himself, he could not quite help but consider that their actions were motivated by strategy: that the enemy lied beyond Ayodhya, and was seeking not merely to save Ayodhya, but something far greater.<br>A cold, calculating intellect much like his own.<br>He mouthed two syllables.<br>“Kr̥ṣṇa.”]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/vasudeva/2.7_ayodhya_2.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/vasudeva/2.7_ayodhya_2.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 16:34:10 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[2.8_death]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Years ago, Vāsudeva had argued with Saṃkarṣaṇa about the nature of the order he had instituted – argued that he was bureaucratizing the problem rather than solving it; that they could simply assassinate Ajātaśatru rather than create an organization to fight the Magadhas for generations. It was not Saṃkarṣaṇa who had humbled Vāsudeva, but Ajātaśatru himself: for each plot of Vāsudeva’s was matched by an diabolical counter-play by Ajātaśatru, and that had made him quite less fond of the simplistic solutions he had thought of earlier.<br>So when Ajātaśatru had invited him to a private audience with him in a barren tract, Vāsudeva had immediately identified that the purpose of the meeting was to have the other assassinated, and demanded that the battle be a game of wits: neither party would be allowed to bring weapons, and each would be surrounded by their most trusted friends, to avoid frivolous and obvious games like replacing one’s opponent’s guards with traitors or bribing such guards to do one’s bidding.<br>Ajātaśatru’s interest had been piqued, and he had brought along with himself his son and some wicked ministers who shared his goals.<br>Vāsudeva had brought with himself some trusted advisors and classmates who shared his goals.<br>“So you are the famed Krishna,” Ajātaśatru commented, “Vāsudeva Krishna. I must say I am impressed by how you have fought against me. We are very similar minds, you and I – are we not?”<br>“A mind is defined not only by its intellect,” said Vāsudeva, “But also by its morality.”<br>Ajātaśatru was fully naked, and his chest hair was dry and sticky, stained brown with blood, but nothing that posed a security threat – he had earlier excused his appearance by stating that he had just mauled a palm-reader who had foolishly approached him and insulted his intelligence by requesting royal funding.<br>“Morality, religion … I expected better of you, Krishna. You must know that I have very little respect for such ideas.”<br>When Vāsudeva did not respond, Ajātaśatru continued:<br>“Years ago, in the midst of my war against the Licchavis, when I had conquered only part of their country, I was approached by a band of celebrating monks, who told me they were very pleased with the outcomes of my conquest. Ordinarily, I would have beheaded them on the spot for the pathetic attempt at flattery, but I did not have my sword with me at the time – for I had been too occupied blinding a child after I had just violated his mother before his eyes – and so I entertained them.<br>“They told me that they were celebrating, because their master had predicted my victory – for I was more righteous than the Licchavi king was, and I surrounded myself with better and wiser company than he did. Ordinarily, I would have not cared more than to remind my minister to execute this master and all his disciples. But I was bored, for the Licchavis were not worthy opponents as you have been, and decided to pay this master a visit.<br>“And I told him: O Wise One, I have lost the war against the Licchavis. What do you recommend I do? And he replied: Indeed, this is just as I predicted – for the Licchavi king is more righteous than you, and he surrounds himself with better and wiser company than you do.<br>“So I told him: my life has descended into tragedy, O Wise One! My kingdom is running out of wealth, my wife has left me as a result of my wicked ways, I am no longer able to find my daily quota of idiots for hunting. And he replied: embrace my religion, and all your problems will be solved.<br>“I told him: I lied. My kingdom will never run out of wealth, as I can seize as much as I want from those I vanquish in battle, my wives cannot leave me as they are imprisoned, and I will never run out of idiots to murder, there are far too many of them. And I was enraged – I am always enraged when I am lied to – and so instead of murdering him, I beat him senseless until he could not speak complete sentences, then locked him with a parrot that had only been exposed to damaged lunatics; and then after a year of him re-learning language from this parrot, I returned him to his disciples.<br>“He had been driven so insane, he blabbered such utterly meaningless words to his disciples – I thought there was no means by which he would ever be taken seriously again. I was interested to find if the disciples would abandon him or continue to care for him for what he had once been, if they would dismiss and ostracize their former master or if they would curse me for subjecting him to such a state. Imagine my shock: when the disciples immediately started worshipping him as their master again – referring to him still as the Wise One – described his change in manner while in Magadha not as insanity, but as enlightenment!<br>“He said such idiotic things as: desire is the cause of all suffering! That life is suffering! Why, for them, it ought to be! And they created fabulous tales of his miracles – and when these tales reached the people, they went to him requesting that he perform for miracles for them – and when he was unable to perform them, his disciples shamed those who had pleaded his help, and created fabulous rationalizations for his inability to help them! And that was when I knew – how depraved the religious truly are – for they will believe and worship any man who dons a simple attire and lives as a hermit. I ask: how am I more wicked than this master? For I murdered my wife, while he left his to rot; I laughed at funerals, while he told people to not mourn. Not cursed – I am celebrated by his followers now as a hero for my role in helping their master reach enlightenment!<br>“I have heard: the worshippers of Brahma are unable to obtain knowledge, the worshippers of Viṣṇu are unable to obtain wealth, and the worshippers of Shiva are unable to obtain strength – should I then simply choose not to worship any of these gods, if they are only hurdles in my path – should it not be my responsibility to overthrow such gods and seize the universe for myself? O, what a wolf can do, in a world of sheep!”<br>But Vāsudeva cut off his long-time rival, nearly ignoring the entire monologue:<br>“I suspect that you are intelligent enough to simulate in your head my argument against you – just as I am intelligent enough to simulate yours in mine. But that is not why we are here – no, not to debate religion.”<br>“Indeed,” said Ajātaśatru. “We should cut out the pretences: we are here to assassinate each other with our wits.”<br>“Not quite,” said Vāsudeva.<br>“No?”<br>“If that were the objective, neither of us would have had cause to meet in person and risk mutual destruction. No – do make another guess at my objective. If we are truly of alike mind, then you should be able to discover it.”<br>Ajātaśatru pondered this challenge.<br>“If you are of like mind to me,” he said at last, “Then you will bring a proposal that you believe to benefit both our goals. I cannot think of such a proposal.”<br>“Your goal is the demonstration of what a wolf can do in a world of sheep,” said Vāsudeva, “What is my goal?”<br>“Some religious insanity.”<br>“The propagation of the light of the Vedas and the prosperous civilization that it has created. Do you see any contradiction between these goals?”<br>Ajātaśatru hummed, thinking.<br>“There isn’t,” said Vāsudeva simply. “I see you. Every instinct in your body tells you to behead me on the spot – but you have no sword. You fume – but it is because you know I am right.”<br>“Do you truly think that conforming to the words of some dead old Brāhmaṇas is a wolf’s behaviour?”<br>“O, what a wolf can do in a world of sheep,” Vāsudeva mimicked, “What, Great King? What can a wolf do in a world of sheep? A great deal of wicked – or a great deal of good—”<br>“What’s the difference?”<br>“If there is truly no difference, then why have you consistently chosen wicked over good? It can be no coincidence.”<br>It was not common for Ajātaśatru to be silenced – he was much too intelligent to be defeated in argument, and it was a great blow to his ego to have this done in the presence of all those closest to him – but whatever shred of sanity was left in him, that hadn’t disappeared over the course of his chaotic reign, managed to surface to acknowledge Krishna as his intellectual equal, as someone worthy of arguing against – at least so long as he did not engage in any specific moralizing.<br>“So many of your actions,” Vāsudeva continued, “So much of your personality does not follow from your professed goal, even though you pretend it is. What goal does it follow from? Not demonstrating what a wolf can do in a world of sheep – no – but demonstrating that you ARE a wolf in a world of sheep.”<br>“Are you calling me a pretender?”<br>“It is not a wolf’s behaviour to conform for the purpose of conforming – and it is not a wolf’s behaviour to rebel for the purpose of rebelling – for in making an explicit effort to act in a way contrary to the words of these dead old Brāhmaṇas you speak of, you have made yourself a slave to their word, for every action you take you must first recall their word, and ensure that it is contrary to it.”<br>“Very well. I will do what I want. I still do not see what your proposal is.”<br>“I propose that you make me the heir to the throne of Pāṭaliputra.”<br>“ … ”<br>“Father,” said Udayin, “You are not truly considering this proposal, are you?”<br>“ … ”<br>“ … Father?”<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>“ … ”<br>Udayin stood over his father’s lifeless body – his right hand grasping onto the needle that his most trusted attendant had advised him to tie into his hair during the meeting with Krishna.<br>“O,” he drawled, “What a wolf can accomplish, in a world of sheep.”<br>For once, he understood exactly what Krishna’s play had been – in demanding that they both attend surrounded by their most trusted associates, he had created an advantage for himself, for that was simply the level of trust his associates enjoyed in him – unlike Father’s associates ever had.<br>“I believe,” Vāsudeva said almost inaudibly, as an eagle circled in the sky far high above, “That it is now truly a world of only sheep.”]]></description><link>https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/vasudeva/2.8_death.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">chapters/vasudeva/2.8_death.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sri Mahalingam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2024 09:21:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[dasarajna]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>chapter title ideas: Commanding heights; Co-operating with the enemy; Bureaucracy; Conspiracy theories; The relations between truths<br><br>Strategy<br>
<br>Getting an army

<br>Establish Candragupta as a king via Aśvakāyana and Sanjaya/Scythian connections, seduction of Bactrian women etc.
<br>Get Magadha (mostly vassal) army to fight Greeks via forgery, and maneuver to have Candragupta be its commander
<br>Now Candragupta is firmly the king of Audicya, and also in the eyes of the Greeks the king of the Central Country
<br>Seal of the Peacock; rob their treasury when left unguarded due to civil war


<br>Controlling the flow of information

<br>Manipulate Magadha into closing itself off to trade, via starting provocations/cold war with Arjunāyanas etc. and having Rupakośa tell Augraseniya what to do in response
<br>Control what information Magadha receives about the war in the Western theatre; send conflicting claims to any true information so they don’t know what’s true and what’s false
<br>Forgeries, often accompanied by assassinations of key people to maintain plausible deniability (and making it seem traitorous to defy the hawkish will of a dead man)


<br>Mess up Magadha

<br>Create a civil war between Augraseniya, Sakadala, Pabbata and a fourth party
<br>Make them too occupied to maintain stability among their vassals or suppress dissension
<br>Give the most loyal factions of their army to the Greeks


<br>Staged invasion

<br>Idea: first, get the Scythians in and corner them with Magadha. Then, get the Scythians past the Magadha army and corner the Magadha army with them.
<br>Scythians invade India: they pass through Candragupta’s territory because of <a class="internal-link" data-href="chapters/rough/4/canakya_ghrtaci_more_convo.md" href="https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/rough/4/canakya_ghrtaci_more_convo.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">canakya_ghrtaci_more_convo</a>
<br>The Greeks “betray”, and the Greek-Scythian combined army makes large gains against the Magadhan vassals. 
<br>Pabbata conducts a direct attack on Pataliputra, assassinating Augraseniya. Kaivarta is crowned king. Magadha refuses help against Greeks/Scythians, maybe forgery.
<br>Sakadala captures and executes Pabbata, making him a martyr. And he has only said good things about Cāṇakya and Candragupta, so now Magadhas are sympathetic. <a class="internal-link" data-href="chapters/rough/4/martyr.md" href="https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/rough/4/martyr.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">martyr</a>
<br>Candragupta arrives with his army from the North-West, capturing away from Greeks/Scythains, and places his own men in their place
<br>Magadha attempts to intervene, but a second invasion is rumoured. The armies have to unite. Sakadala takes over, and pledges support. (He’s suspicious: how did the Scythians pass through Chandragupta’s territory? Because Gandhara betrayed, under a Greek general from Arachosia.)
<br>But he demands that Candragupta take his forces to the Western frontier. They bicker.
<br>Meanwhile, captured Greek and Scythian forces are secretly released, and they rampage further East, at Cāṇakya’s word.
<br>Sakadala realizes what’s happening, forms a defensive position around Magadha proper (not the empire), hoping Cāṇakya does not have ambitions of conquering Magadha itself. But his horses have to go first to stop the urgent Scythian threat, and they kill each other. <a class="internal-link" data-href="chapters/rough/4/resistance_futile.md" href="https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/rough/4/resistance_futile.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">resistance_futile</a>
<br>Cāṇakya has left the Scythians to die at Sakadala’s hand, and instead is going around establishing garrisons and support among vassal kings and sabotaging the elephantry. <a class="internal-link" data-href="chapters/rough/4/conference.md" href="https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/rough/4/conference.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">conference</a>
<br>Candragupta’s army is hesistant, but he convinces them and leads a cavalry charge into Magadha, bypassing Sakadala’s elephantry via the burned land the left by the Scythians. <a class="internal-link" data-href="chapters/rough/4/speech.md" href="https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/rough/4/speech.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">speech</a>
<br>Cāṇakya constructs some fake camps as a decoy against Sakadala’s elephants: local craftsmen logged and cleared land and hauled wood and stone, Greeks built a fortress, Indians booby-trapped it and Persians decorated it to make it look convincing. Rapti Ghaghara confluence.
<br>possibly: <a class="internal-link" data-href="chapters/rough/4/greek_dark_day.md" href="https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/rough/4/greek_dark_day.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">greek_dark_day</a>


<br>Getting the corporations to come around — so far they’ve been told two different kings would rule from two different sides. Some of them are already in pocket from Candragupta’s earlier connections

(320 BC, age 27) Chandragupta is also troubled by the incident and goes to Bhadrabahu, being suspicious of Cāṇakya deep down.<br>
(319 BC, age 28) <a class="internal-link" data-href="chapters/rough/6/bhadrabahu_debate.md" href="https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/rough/6/bhadrabahu_debate.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">bhadrabahu_debate</a><br>
(314 BC, age 33) Chandragupta returns to Pataliputra after 5 years in the South.<br>Dreams order<br>
<br>Before Durdhara’s death (321bc): Dream 2 (kalpavriksha).
<br>Before Southern campaign (320bc): Dream 11 (young bulls)
<br>313, 312 … 300 bc: all the other dreams.
<br>(310 BC, age 37) Bindusara admitted to Taxila.<br>(298 BC, age 49) While initially Chandragupta tries to prevent what Bhadrabahu says about the dreams, but later dreams have worse interpretations, like “the king will assist in oppressing the people”. Etc. Chandragupta doesn’t want to be that king, and decides to abdicate. <a class="internal-link" data-href="chapters/rough/6/canakya_candragupta_final_words.md" href="https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/rough/6/canakya_candragupta_final_words.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">canakya_candragupta_final_words</a><br>Chanakya goes to Pataliputra to advise Bindusara on Chandragupta’s request who is now 24.<br><br>Cāṇakya’s son — call him Kāmaṇḍaka for now<br>

Makes convincing case for becoming barbarians, Cāṇakya hits him<br>
He rebels against the empire, is caught and sentenced to exile. Cāṇakya tells him to go make his own empire, among the barbarians.<br>
He goes with a blackbuck<br>
speech; exercise the three puruśārtha on the conquered countries<br>Timeline<br>
(288 BC, age 59) “You need to marry a new woman and start producing more princes immediately. One of your sons thinks that life has no value, the other thinks that the value of life lies in its death.” “Bindusara: I thought you liked me. Chanakya: I do like you. Bindusara: Well, how do you speak to kings you don’t like? Chanakya: I don’t speak to them, I end their lineages.” And while death is not a traditional penalty for failing an exam, for these two … please consider it.<br>
(278 BC, age 69) Rebellion at Taxila as it is Buddhistifying, Ashoka sent to pacify it. Returns reporting that “They have no problem with the Emperor, only his ministers” in order to get Chanakya out of the picture. Cāṇakya convincingly points out <br><br><br>Set in 800 BC, featuring Rāma, Bharata, Janaka, Hanumān, Yājñavalkya, Agastya, Uddalaka Aruṇi. And maybe a flashback about the Ārya-Paṇi reconcillation.

<br>1 Takṣaśila Kāṇḍa (The Taxila Chapter). In a world where the Vedic light appears to be dying, crushed from both sides by the Magadhas and the Persians, a young Cāṇakya resolves to make some changes.

<br>2 Mathura Kāṇḍa (The Mathura Chapter). Cāṇakya makes contact the mysterious Order of Saṅkarṣaṇa, and seeks to be titled as their chosen hero. But for that he must first rise as a statesman, plotting, with his new aides, some of his first schemes to manipulate the great empires of his day.

<br>3 Yavana Kāṇḍa (The Hellenic Chapter). A new player appears on the scene, an ambitious conqueror from a distant land called Macedon. But Cāṇakya intends to turn this into an opportunity, and ensure that the fruits of the newcomer’s efforts will be solely reaped by Candragupta.

<br>write the book — according to <a class="internal-link" data-href="outline.md" href="https://srajma.github.io/book/outline.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">outline</a> and at heads below
<br>standardization

<br>Write README and outline
<br>Standardize everything in <a class="internal-link" data-href="lore.md" href="https://srajma.github.io/book/lore.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">lore</a> including  r̥ ṁ, and make the changes throughout the book
<br>Standardize quotation formats and italics (in flashback chapters, <a class="internal-link" data-href="chapters/specials/quotes/arthashastra/full_page_vizhdam.md" href="https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/specials/quotes/arthashastra/full_page_vizhdam.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">full_page_vizhdam</a>)
<br>Em dash en dash
<br>Spell check


<br>simple tasks

<br>try replacing the “Magadha culture” stuff with something else, maybe Vrātyas or something e.g. <a class="internal-link" data-href="chapters/3/3.9.md" href="https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/3/3.9.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">3.9</a>. Also emphasize caste less, it’s a bit putting-off.
<br>Remove excessive boomer words like civilization and culture
<br>try to reflect that the Persian acquisitions in India were only brief and temporary (see <a class="internal-link" data-href="chapters/specials/quotes/greek/README.md#never_invaded" href="https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/specials/quotes/greek/README.html#never_invaded" target="_self" rel="noopener">never_invaded</a>) — also reduce the prominence of Sindh in the book, it was a relatively small region back then
<br>write travel scenes better, reflecting a caravan scene — though can still point out that trade had stalled due to Nanda neglect of infrastructure etc.
<br>the two visitors in the prologue should be messengers not professors
<br>probably remove the stupid humour attempt calling Seleucus fat <a class="internal-link" data-href="chapters/3/3.12.md" href="https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/3/3.12.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">3.12</a> — oh, I also called some student’s mother fat <a class="internal-link" data-href="chapters/1/1.10.md" href="https://srajma.github.io/book/chapters/1/1.10.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">1.10</a>
<br>add bit about buying female guards from the Greeks


<br>big tasks

<br>write female characters better — Yaśomatī, Puṣkaradhāriṇī, Ghr̥tācī. What are some genuinely well-written female characters in literature?
<br>add images


<br><br>Heads where writing is to be appended<br>
<br>insert stuff about Alexander’s supply route being cut off<br>
<br><br>Despite his great outwardly pronouncements, the conqueror of the world  
<br>this is weird. And should include more specifics<br>
<br><br>Such lies! Such lies, that his enemies propagated – enemies on the inside! 
<br>this whole excerpt doesn’t really make sense, get a better reason for Sakadala to get suspicious<br>
<br><br>“The enemy is smart.”  
<br>main head, where writing should be continued:<br>
4.2<br><br><br>With the Greek threat removed, the armies stationed in Kamboja – Aśvaka, Scythian and Greek alike – were now freed from defensive occupation. With her acquisition of the Greek mercenary troops, none dared defy Queen Ghṛtācī’s sovereignty, her control over these armies – and they would also complement the strengths of these armies in offense.<br>Blame Magadha for being bureaucratic and preventing them from stopping the invasion
<br><br>things to keep in mind while writing a script to compile<br>
<br>date formats
<br>embeds, including quote embeds
<br>full page vizhdam quotes
<br>chapter titles
<br>line spacings esp. at the start and end of embeds and chapters
<br><br>Date formats should be given e.g.<br>[date:-340|magadha,“but in the sleepy Southern city of Pratiṣṭhāna”,x]
Copy<br>
<br>-340 is the Christian year (340 BC)
<br>magadha indicates that the year in Magadha hegemony (i.e. years from its epoch 492 BC) should be given
<br>“but in the sleepy Southern city of Pratiṣṭhāna” is custom text to be added
<br>x indicates that the year in Christian calendar should be given
<br>Before compiling, run a script to compile dates. The above example should ideally be rendered as:<br>&lt;center&gt;
In the 152nd year of Magadha hegemony
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
but in the sleepy Southern city of Pratiṣṭhāna
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(340 BC)
&lt;/center&gt;
Copy<br>Calendar format standards:<br>
<br>magadha
<br>x
<br>age_canakya
<br>flashback (counted from the last-mentioned non-flashback date)
